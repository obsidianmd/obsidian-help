## Settings

The settings can be found by clicking the gear in the bottom left corner, or by hitting `Ctrl/Cmd-,`. Most of them are fairly self-explanatory, but here are some notes that might be helpful.

- Most of the settings are toggle switches. If there are more details to a setting, it may have a gear next to the switch for additional settings. For example, the gear next to Spell Check reveals the custom dictionary, so you can remove words you may have accidentally added.
- Enabling plugins will cause their settings to appear in the list of tabs. For example, when you enable Custom CSS, a community themes tab will appear that allows for choosing a custom CSS theme.
