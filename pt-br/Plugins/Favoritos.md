Find files easier by starring them. You can find your starred files by clicking the **Starred** (star icon) tab in the left sidebar, or by running **Show starred notes** from the [[en/Plugins/Command palette]].

Click the name of a file in the **Starred** pane to open it.

You can reorder starred files in the **Starred** pane by clicking and dragging them.

To star a note:

**File explorer:**

- Right-click a file in [[pt-br/Plugins/Explorador de arquivos]] and click **Star**.

**Options menu:**

- Click **More options** in the upper-right corner of a note, and then click **Star**.

**Command palette:**

1. Press `Ctrl+P` (or `Cmd+P` on macOS) to open the [[en/Plugins/Command palette]].
2. Search for the **Star/unstar current file** command.
3. Press `Enter` with the command selected to toggle the active note.

To unstar a file, use the same steps as when starring a note. The option instead shows **Unstar**.
