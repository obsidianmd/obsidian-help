While Obsidian is free of charge for personal use, you can support the Obsidian development by purchasing a _Catalyst_ license.

While the Catalyst license doesn't grant you any additional features inside the app itself, you'll receive exclusive benefits, such as:

- Early access to [[#Enable Insider builds|Insider builds]].
- Access to exclusive [[#Join our Insider channels|Insider channels]].
- Cool and unique [[#Get your forum badge|forum badges]] and [[#Get your Discord badge|Discord badges]].

> [!Note] Commercial use
> If you use Obsidian for work, you may need to obtain a [[Commercial license]].
