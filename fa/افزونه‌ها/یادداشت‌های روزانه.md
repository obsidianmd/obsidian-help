Daily notes opens a note based on today's date, or creates it if it doesn't exist. Use daily notes to create journals, to-do lists, or daily logs for things you discovered during the day.

To open today's daily note, either:

- Click **Open today's daily note** (calendar with checkmark icon) in the [[نوار|ribbon]].
- Run **Open today's daily note** from the [[فرمان‌دان]].
- [[میانبرهای دلخواه#Setting hotkeys|Use a hotkey]] for the **Open today's daily note** command.

By default, Obsidian creates a new empty note named after today's date in the YYYY-MM-DD format.

> [!tip]
> If you prefer to have your daily notes in a separate folder, you can set the **New file location** under plugin options to change where Obsidian creates new daily notes.

## Create a daily note from template

If your daily notes have the same structure, you can use a [[الگوها|template]] to add pre-defined content to your daily notes when you create them.

1. Create a new note named "Daily template" with the following text (or whatever makes sense to you!):

   ```md
   # {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}

   ## Tasks

   - [ ]
   ```

2. Open **Settings**.
3. In the sidebar, click **Daily notes** under **Plugin options**.
4. In the text box next to **Template file location**, select the "Daily template" note.

Obsidian uses the template the next time you create a new daily note.
