---
Obsidian stores your notes as [[نحوِ قالب‌بندیِ پایه|Markdown-formatted]] plain text files in a _vault_. A vault is a folder on your local file system, including any subfolders.

Because notes are plain text files, you can use other text editors and file managers to edit and manage notes. Obsidian automatically refreshes your vault to keep up with any external changes.

You can create a vault anywhere your operating system allows. Obsidian syncs with Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive, Git, and many other third-party services.

You can open multiple folders as individual vaults, for example to separate notes for work and personal use.

## تنظیماتِ خزانه

Obsidian creates an `.obsidian` folder in the root folder of the vault, which contains preferences specific to that vault, such as [[میانبرهای دلخواه]], [[پوسته‌ها]], and [[افزونه‌های انجمن]].

By default, most operating systems hide folders that start with a period (`.`), so you may need to update the settings for your file manager to see it.

- **macOS**: In Finder, press `Cmd+Shift+.` (period) to show hidden files.
- **Windows**: [Show hidden files](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-hidden-files-0320fe58-0117-fd59-6851-9b7f9840fdb2)

> [!tip] Adding `.obsidian` to Git
> The `.obsidian/workspace` file stores the current workspace layout, and changes any time you open a new file. If you use [Git](https://git-scm.com) to version control your vault, you may want to add the `.obsidian/workspace` file to `.gitignore`.

## تنظیماتِ سراسری

Obsidian stores global settings in a system folder. The location of the system folder depends on the operating system you're using.

- **macOS**: `/Users/yourusername/Library/Application Support/obsidian`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Obsidian\`
- **Linux**: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/obsidian/` or `~/.config/obsidian/`

> [!warning] هشدار
> Don't create a vault in the system folder. This may lead to corrupted data or data loss.
