Obsidian Publish is a cloud-based service where you can publish your notes to the world.

Select the notes you want to share with the world, press "Publish", and we'll post it to publish.obsidian.md/your-site.

If you're reading this on [help.obsidian.md](https://help.obsidian.md), you're already looking at a site that uses Obsidian Publish. You can see the vault on [GitHub](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-docs).
