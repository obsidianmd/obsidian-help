The ribbon is a space for common commands that occupies the vertical space at the very left of the interface. It’s part of the left [[Sidebar]] and is always visible, even if the left sidebar is closed.

## Actions

Each action is presented by an icon in the ribbon. Hovering them will present a tooltip; clicking or tapping them will activate the action.

The top ones are added by plugins, both [[Core plugins|core plugins]] and [[community plugins]].

The bottom three actions are Obsidian system actions to:

1. Open another vault;
2. Get help (opens [[help vault]] on the [[desktop app]] and opens [[online help]] in the [[Obsidian Mobile|mobile app]]);
3. Open settings.
