Slash commands allow you to perform commands from inside the editor by typing a forward slash (`/`) at the beginning of a line or after any blank space.

To run a command using Slash commands:

1. In the editor, type a forward slash (`/`).
2. Enter the name of the command you want to run to search the list of available commands.
3. Navigate to the command using the arrow keys.
4. Press Enter.

To exit the Slash command search without invoking a command, press `Esc` or the `Space` key.

> [!TIP] Fuzzy matching
> Like the [[Command palette]], Slash commands supports fuzzy matching which lets you search commands even if you don't know their exact names. For example, type "scf" to find the **Save current file** command.
