## New

- Added a [command line interface](<https://help.obsidian.md/cli>) that lets you control Obsidian from your terminal for scripting, automation, and integration with external tools.
- Added a search toolbar button to Bases to filter query results.
- When deleting a file, a new prompt will ask if you would like to also delete its attachments. A new setting in **Files & Links** allows you to configure this behavior (choose "Always", "Ask every time", or "Never").
- Images in Live Preview can now be resized by dragging from the corner. Double-click the corner to reset the image size.

## Improved

### Bases

- Table cell context menu now shows the file menu when a single file is selected.

### File Explorer

- Copy and paste operations are now supported using `Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V`.

### Editor

- Added new menu item when you right-click in the empty space next to the editor:
	- Toggle line numbers
	- Toggle inline title
- Fixed missing space after blockquotes.
- Fixed styling of bold links.
- Image size is no longer treated as display text when dragging a link.

### Other

- Backlinks in Canvas files are now detected. They are now shown in the backlinks view, and counted as links in the Graph view.
- "Change vault..." has been renamed to "Manage vaults".
- Added a new "Change vault..." command to quickly switch between vaults via the keyboard.
- Added a new "Open vault..." command to open an existing vault via the keyboard and keep the current vault open.
- Alt-clicking a file in the file explorer now adds the previous active item to the selection.
- Quick switcher: Dragging results out of the modal is now supported.
- New app translations are available.

## No longer broken

- Keychain: Added handling for when encryption is unavailable on some Linux machines.
- Fixed issue where layout is not always saved when the app is closed.
- Fixed issue where selecting text near a link or tag would incorrectly trigger the link or tag token.
- Fixed issue where closing a pop-out window with active notices would cause them to move to the main window and never disappear.
- Added a new `unique` [URI action](<https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Obsidian+URI>).

## Developers

- We've updated how our translation files are created and bundled with the app. For translators, see the [updated instructions on our translations repository](<https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-translations>).
- Added theming support for corner shapes using `corner-shape` CSS property. Replaced `-electron-corner-smoothing`. Requires Chromium 139 and Obsidian 1.11+.
- macOS: New `traffic-lights-offset-x` and `--traffic-lights-offset-y` CSS variables to configure with the traffic lights appear in the window frame.
- We've introduced a breaking API change to `BaseOption#shouldHide`. This function no longer receives the config as an argument. Options should be accessed from `BasesViewRegistration.options` instead.

```ts
registerView('my-view-id', {
		name: 'View Name',
		icon: 'my-icon',
		factory: () => new MyView(),
		options: (config: BasesViewConfig) => ({
			// Here ^
		})
});
```
