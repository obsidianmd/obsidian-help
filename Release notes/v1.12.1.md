## No longer broken

- Fixed language selector not allowing you to choose "English" if the device language is not English.
- CLI: If the vault parameter is included, it must be the first argument.
- Attempting to open a second instance of the app (e.g. from the Windows task bar) will now open the vault starter again.
- Live Preview: Fixed SVGs not rendering.
- The `daily:prepend` CLI command now inserts content after the frontmatter instead of at the very beginning of the file.
