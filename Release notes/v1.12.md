## New

- Added a [command line interface](<https://help.obsidian.md/cli>) that lets you control Obsidian from your terminal for scripting, automation, and integration with external tools.
- Added a search toolbar button to Bases to filter query results.
- When deleting a file, a new prompt will ask if you would like to also delete its attachments. A new setting in **Files & Links** allows you to configure this behavior (choose "Always", "Ask every time", or "Never").
- Images in Live Preview can now be resized by dragging from the corner. Double-click the corner to reset the image size.

## Improvements

### Bases

- Table cell context menu now shows the file menu when a single file is selected.

### File Explorer

- Copy and paste operations are now supported using `Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V`.

### Editor

- Added command palette commands to toggle inline title and line numbers visibility.
- Fixed missing space after blockquotes.
- Fixed styling of bold links.
- Image size is no longer treated as display text when dragging a link.
- Clicking near embedded content no longer accidentally switches from reading mode to edit mode.

### Other

- Backlinks in Canvas files are now detected. They are now shown in the backlinks view, and counted as links in the Graph view.
- Added a "Change vault" command to quickly switch between vaults.
- Alt-clicking a file in the file explorer now adds the previous active item to the selection.
- Quick switcher: Dragging results out of the modal is now supported.

## No longer broken

- Keychain: Added handling for when encryption is unavailable on some Linux machines.
- Fixed issue where layout is not always saved when the app is closed.
- Fixed issue where selecting text near a link or tag would incorrectly trigger the link or tag token.
- Fixed issue where closing a pop-out window with active notices would cause them to move to the main window and never disappear.
- Added a new `unique` [URI action](<https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Obsidian+URI>).

## Developers

- We've updated how our translation files are created and bundled with the app.
- Added theming support for corner shapes using `corner-shape` CSS property. Replaced `-electron-corner-smoothing`. Requires Chromium 139 and Obsidian 1.11+.
- macOS: New `traffic-lights-offset-x` and `--traffic-lights-offset-y` CSS variables to configure with the traffic lights appear in the window frame.
