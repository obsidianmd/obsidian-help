## New

### Obsidian CLI

This release introduces the Obsidian CLI, a [command line interface](<https://help.obsidian.md/cli>) that lets you control Obsidian from your terminal for scripting, automation, and integration with external tools.

For installation help, check the [troubleshooting section](<https://help.obsidian.md/cli#Troubleshooting>) for the platform-specific information.

### Image resizing

Images in Live Preview can now be resized by dragging from the corner. Double-click the corner to reset the image size.

### Automatic attachment cleanup

When deleting a file, a prompt will ask if you would also like to delete its attachments. A new setting in **Files & Links** allows you to configure this behavior (choose "Always", "Ask every time", or "Never").

## Improvements

### Bases

- Added a search toolbar button to filter query results.
- Added the ability to import files into Bases via drag and drop.
- Right-clicking on a single row in table view now shows context menu items related to that file.

### File Explorer

- Copy and paste operations are now supported using `Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V` (`Cmd-C/Cmd-V` on macOS).

### Editor

- Added new menu items when you right-click in the empty space next to the editor:
	- Toggle line numbers
	- Toggle inline title
- Fixed missing space after blockquotes.
- Fixed styling of bold links.
- Image size is no longer treated as display text when dragging a link.

### Other

- Added detection for backlinks in Canvas files. They now appear in the Backlinks view, and count as links in the Graph view.
- "Change vault..." has been renamed to "Manage vaults".
- Added a new "Change vault..." command to quickly switch between vaults via the keyboard.
- Added a new "Open vault..." command to open an existing vault via the keyboard and keep the current vault open.
- Alt-clicking a file in the File Explorer now adds the previous active item to the selection.
- Quick switcher: Dragging results is now supported.
- Added new "Copy image" menu item when right-clicking on an image.
- Copying text from the editor now includes HTML formatting, making it easier to paste into apps like Google Docs.
- Obsidian Sync now logs when files were skipped for being too large.
- Improved fuzzy search results when the query contains spaces.
- Opening files in an external application now shows a confirmation dialog for added safety.
- Added a warning when attempting to open an executable file.
- Added new app translations.

## No longer broken

### Other

- Keychain: Added handling for when encryption is unavailable on some Linux machines.
- Fixed issue where layout was not always saved when the app is closed.
- Fixed issue where selecting text near a link or tag would incorrectly trigger the link or tag token.
- Fixed issue where closing a pop-out window with active notices would cause them to move to the main window and never disappear.
- Added a new `unique` [URI action](<https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Obsidian+URI>).
- Fixed the outline view flickering while typing.
- Fixed scroll position not updating after changing the row height in Bases table view.
- Fixed "More options" menu not closing when clicking the "..." button in a pop-out window.
- Fixed list properties not showing edit and remove options in the context menu when right-clicking a link inside a list item.
- File Explorer: Fixed "Duplicate" menu item generating an incomplete folder name when duplicating a folder that includes "." in the name.

## Developers

- We've updated how our translation files are created and bundled with the app. For translators, see the [updated instructions on our translations repository](<https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-translations>).
- Added theming support for corner shapes using `corner-shape` CSS property. Replaced `-electron-corner-smoothing`. Requires Chromium 139 and Obsidian 1.11+.
- macOS: New `traffic-lights-offset-x` and `--traffic-lights-offset-y` CSS variables to configure where the traffic lights appear in the window frame. These offsets are now applied immediately when the app loads.
- We've introduced a breaking API change to `BaseOption#shouldHide`. This function no longer receives the config as an argument. Options should be accessed from `BasesViewRegistration.options` instead.

```ts
registerView('my-view-id', {
		name: 'View Name',
		icon: 'my-icon',
		factory: () => new MyView(),
		options: (config: BasesViewConfig) => ({
			// Here ^
		})
});
```

- Added `appendBinary` method to the vault and adapter API.
