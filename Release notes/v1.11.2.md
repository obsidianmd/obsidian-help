## Improvements

- URI: `new`, `open`, and `daily` URI actions now support a new `paneType` param.

| Param | Description |
| ------| ----------- |
| `paneType=tab` | Open in a new tab |
| `paneType=split` | Open in a new tab group |
| `paneType=window` | Open in a pop-out window (Desktop only) |

## No longer broken

- Fixed "Move file" selector not showing the vault root (`/`) as a valid destination.
- Fixed bug where "No plugin updates found" toast never disappears.
- Fixed minor visual regression of the sidebar tab buttons.
- Graph view: Attachments no longer show the full file path.
- Bases: Fixed issues with list view virtualization when grouping is configured. Fixed groups not displaying while scrolling.
- Daily note: Fixed "Open next daily note" and "Open previous daily note" commands not working when daily note format included a folder path.
- Fixed display of bolded links in reading mode (e.g. `**[[link]]**`).
