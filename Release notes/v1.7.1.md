## Improvements

- Page previews will stay open even if the window loses focus or the command palette appears.
- Spellcheck is now disabled for inline tags.
- Pressing `Esc` now instantly closes the page preview while editing.
- Dragging a `.webloc` or `.url` file into the editor creates a Markdown link with the filename as the display text.
- Hovering over a notice keeps it on screen until you move the mouse away.
- Added a right-click menu for footnotes to delete both the footnote and its reference.
- Fixed math rendering in footnotes.
