This update focuses on improving some long-standing sore points in the app. Most notably, we have overhauled the app interface for **better support of right-to-left (RTL) languages**. Now when the app language is set to an RTL language, the entire interface will be mirrored. We have also given a lot of attention to improving the editing and reading experience of **footnotes**. This release is jam-packed with bug fixes, but you might also notice some performance improvements when loading the app and while editing.

#### Highlights

- RTL Support. The interface direction is now mirrored when the app is set to an RTL language.
- Updated left sidebar layout. A new vault switcher is now shown at the bottom. The app ribbon can now be hidden in settings or by right-clicking on the ribbon and selecting "Hide ribbon."
- Character and word count is now updated based on the current text selection.
- Faster workspace loading.
- Faster editor parsing.

## Improvements

- `Tab` will now complete the path segment of the currently selected file in the Quick switcher and "Move files" modal.
- Added "Add alias" command.
- Added "Create new folder" command.
- Hotkeys and property types are now automatically reloaded if the settings are modified outside of Obsidian.
- Added custom instructions and result when adding display text to a link.
- Prompts now have a "clear" button to clear the input. Pressing the button when there is no input will now dismiss the prompt.
- Page preview popups should now have more consistent sizing and positioning.

### Footnotes

- Add autocompletion for footnote references using `[^`.
- Fixed parsing and rendering of footnotes in the editor.
- Added hover preview support for inline footnotes.
- Hovering over a footnote ID will now display a popup with the corresponding footnote.

### Properties

- You can now double-click on a property list item to edit it.
- Added an edit button to the properties view if the open file has invalid frontmatter.

	- Main settings
	- Appearance settings
	- Hotkeys
	- Core plugins
	- Core plugin settings
	- Video, images, PDFs, and audio

  - `styles.css`
  - `manifest.json`
- Improved loading experience while Sync connects to the remote vault.
- The "purge" button will now appear if storage is more than 95% full.

## Developers

- We have published [a guide](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/User+interface/Right-to-left) for how to adapt your theme or plugin to support RTL interfaces.

### Themes

- Switched to Cascadia Mono instead of Cascadia Code for default monospace on Windows.
- Bold is now computed based on the current text weight, so bold inside a heading will still appear bold.
- Added `--caret-color` CSS variable to make it easier to style caret color on both desktop and mobile.
- Added new `--link-weight` variable.
- The user's interface language is added to the `lang` attribute on the `html` element, which allows language-specific CSS rules.
- The `.mod-rtl` class is added to `body` element when the user's interface language is RTL.

### Plugins

- Fixed `processFrontmatter` failing to process file if all properties are removed.
- Improve detection of external config changes.
- We've made several improvements to the behavior of `app.emulateMobile` that should make it easier to test that your plugins are mobile-compatible. Attempting to run a NodeJS library will present a Notice. Drag and drop will more accurately mirror the behavior on mobile. The app will have default `safe-area-inset` properties set so that your views properly account for offsets in the mobile device viewport (such as the iPhone Dynamic Island).
- Bare modals should respect `safe-area-insets` by default.
- Added loading state to some of the settings button that make remote requests.
- Global `app` has been completely removed from the API spec (previously it was marked as deprecated).
