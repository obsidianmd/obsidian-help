## No longer broken

### CLI

- Fixed the CLI not being detected correctly on Windows (introduced in Obsidian 1.12.3).
- Added a warning message when the CLI is run from an outdated installer.

### Windows

- Fixed a bug with opening external links containing an encoded backslash character (`%5C`).
