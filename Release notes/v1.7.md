## Shiny new things

- Obsidian Sync includes a new view that shows a collection of synchronized files.
- You can now click inside a page preview to edit a file in-place.

## Improvements

- You can now create new footnotes by clicking on the hover preview of a footnote ID.
- Spellcheck is now disabled inside prompts like the quick switcher and command palette.
- Added support for `x.com` embeds in addition to `twitter.com`.
- Right-clicking in the gutter of a Markdown view now lets you quickly toggle line numbers or readable line width.
- The "Make copy of" menu item has been renamed to "Duplicate" on macOS to match OS conventions.
- Obsidian Publish collaborators can now edit content-related site options, including the order of sidebar items.
- The "Close all other tabs" command no longer closes pinned tabs.
- Search view no longer starts loading search results until the view is displayed. This may improve app loading performance.
- Frontmatter is now hidden inside embedded editors such as Canvas file nodes and page preview.
