## Improved

- Secret Storage is now encrypted at rest.
- Daily notes: Folder path is now normalized.
- Daily notes: If you were previously using the "Open daily note on startup" option, you will be automatically migrated to use the new "Files & Links › Default file to open" setting.

## No longer broken

- Fixed **Default file to open** not working when the configured file path omits the file extension.
- Fixed daily notes not opening if the path began with a leading `/` or used `\` as a path delimiter.
- Restored default display text when inserting a link with folders in the linktext (e.g. `[[a/b/file]]` will automatically be inserted as `[[a/b/file|file]]`).

## Developers

- The CSS variables `--blur-translucency-s` and `--blur-translucency-m` have been renamed to `--blur-opacity-s` and `--blur-opacity-m`.
