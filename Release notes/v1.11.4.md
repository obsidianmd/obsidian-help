## No longer broken

- Fixed a bug where switching focus between the main window and a pop-out window could cause the wrong tab to become active.

## Developers

- API: Exposed new SecretStorage and a complementary SecretComponent for plugins to integrate with the secret storage. The secret storage is a new opt-in way for plugins to save keys that might be shared across multiple plugins. For example, a Google API token, or an OpenAI key. Instead of requiring users to copy-paste the same keys into multiple plugin settings, plugins can now fetch keys from a shared collection of secrets identified by a user-provided name.
