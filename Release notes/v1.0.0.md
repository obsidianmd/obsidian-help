Make sure to take a look at the [FAQ section](#faq) which should address some common points of confusion as you adapt to the new Obsidian.

## Tabs

With this update, we have embraced **tabs** throughout the UI. We've found that tabs provide a more intuitive experience for both browsing and editing notes in your vault.

Tabs have had us rethinking some of the most basic interactions with Obsidian. We have taken this opportunity to consolidated the hotkeys for opening files. Combine these modifier keys when click on any link in Obsidian (this includes the quick switcher!) or use them with <kbd>Enter</kdb> to navigate the link under the cursor.

| Action       | MacOS      | Windows/Linux           |
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| **Navigate** | *None*              | *None*                  |
| **New Tab**      | <kbd>⌘</kbd> (+ <kbd>Shift</kbd> in Source Mode) | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (+ <kbd>Shift</kbd> in Source Mode)             |
| **New Tab Group**    | <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⌥</kbd> | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>     |
| **New Window**   | <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⌥</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd> | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd> |

Tabs have also inspired some changes to how users browse their vaults. It felt only natural that we also introduce **per-tab history**. Each tab now maintains its own history for navigation.

## Tab stacks

You can now switch any tab group in your workspace into a _tab stack_. Tab stacks provide an alternative way to view your tabs, reminiscent of Andy's Mode.

*Tab stacks* are, at their heart, the same as a tab group. Try mixing and matching with a tab group on one side and a tab stack on the other.

## New appearance settings

We've introduced quite a few new settings at <kbd>Settings › Appearance</kbd>.

| Setting | Description |
|--|--|
| **Show inline title** | Notes now display the full note title inline with the note contents as an *Inline Title*. You can disable this in settings |
| **Show tab title bar** | Show or hide the title bar at the top of very tab.|
| **Window frame style** | By default, the UI is now in *Frameless* mode. The window title is hidden. In settings, you can choose between the new frameless mode, the custom Obsidian frame (old default), and using the native OS window frame. |
| **Accent color** | There's now an "accent color" color-picker to give your vault its own unique style. Theme support may vary. |
| **Zoom level** | Controls the overall zoom level of the app. |
| **Native menus** | Menus will be rendered to match the context menus provided by the operating system. Enabled by default on MacOS. |

## FAQ

**Q.** Why am I seeing the title of my note duplicated at the top of my note?

> We now display the filename as an **Inline Title** to allow filenames to feel more attached to the note. If you already have the heading of your note matching the filename, you might notice some redundancy. You can disable this feature via <kbd>Appearance › Show inline title</kbd>.

**Q.** Why does everything look so big/small?

> The new update has made some changes to make Obsidian feel more native to your operating system. To adjust the overall scale of the UI, you can configure the **UI Zoom** level in Settings at <kbd>Appearance › Advanced › Zoom level</kbd>.

**Q.** How do I open notes side-by-side now?

> The behavior of `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` and `Cmd/Ctrl + Click` have changed to opening links in a new tab. To open links in a new pane to the right, you can use `Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + Enter` or `Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + Click`.

**Q.** Why can I not toggle checkboxes with <kbd>Mod</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd> anymore?

> The default hotkey for "Toggle checkbox status" has been changed to <kbd>Mod</kbd><kbd>L</kbd>. <kbd>Mod</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd> is now the default hotkey for opening links under the cursor in a new tab. You can change these hotkeys in settings.
