## Improved

- The help window and the vault chooser window have been updated to match the new design used in app settings.
- Bases: Table cell menu now shows "Copy" and "Paste" menu items.
- Settings: The sidebar no longer shows icons next to Community plugins.

## No longer broken

- Bases: Fixed bug where right-clicking on table selection would focus the cell (and hide the selection) instead of showing the selection menu.
- Fixed bug where a note would sometimes switch from reading mode to edit mode when clicking near embedded content.
