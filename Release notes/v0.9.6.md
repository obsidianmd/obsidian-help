Released on 2020/10/20.

## Breaking changes

- Block references now require the `^` character to be part of the link, like so: `[[Filename#^blockid]]`.
- Block auto-complete will generate this new format automatically.
- The old format from v0.9.5 `[[Filename#blockid]]` will stop working.
- A conversion tool is added for existing block references from v0.9.5. Use the Markdown Importer plugin's "Block ID upgrade". Remember to backup your notes since this operates on the whole vault.

## Improvements

- Block auto-complete will also display and search the block ID if one is present.
- Block IDs can now contain the dash character `-`.
- Auto-complete trigger with the prefix `#^` such as `[[Filename#^` now behaves identically to `[[Filename^`.
- "Toggle checklist status" command/hotkey now adds the checkbox syntax `- [ ]` for any selected lines that does not already have a checkbox.

## No longer broken

- Image size syntax now works for internal images using the markdown standard link format.
- Link auto-complete no longer strip characters after a `.` in the filename when using Markdown links.
