## Improvements

- Added icons to settings sections.
- Markdown links are now supported in text properties and list properties. Internal links are automatically updated if the destination file is moved or renamed.
- Daily notes: The daily note format can be selected from a list of predefined formats.
- Attempting to rename a file to include unsafe characters (such as '#' or ']') will only result in a warning.
- When importing files (e.g. via drag and drop), Obsidian will automatically strip out invalid characters from the filename.
- Added a "Copy path" submenu to the file context menu.
- macOS: Toggles and sliders are now styled to match their native counterparts.
- New "Keychain" setting section for storing secrets created for plugins. Plugin API is coming soon.

## No longer broken

- Reference links no longer allow spaces before the link definition.
- Fixed issue where navigating between notes would sometimes cause a flicker when the properties list appeared/disappeared.

## Developers

- Obsidian is now bundled with Inter Variable font instead of Inter. Inter Variable supports variable font weights.
- Added `SettingGroup` to the API. Settings can now be organized into logical groups with optional headers. This should provide a more standardized design language for settings organization.
