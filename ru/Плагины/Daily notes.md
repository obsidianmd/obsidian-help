# Daily Notes

Introduced in [[v0.5.0]], **disabled** by default.


Daily Notes will create a new note that is automatically named with the current date. If it already exists, it will open that note. This is a useful way to create a daily log, todo list, or a list of links to notes that you have created on a specific day.  

The date format and default folder for Daily Notes can be set in Settings => Plugins, by clicking the gear next to the name.  The default date format is "YYYY-MM-DD" (ISO format). This format means that a list of daily notes, listed in alphabetical order, will also be in chronological order. 

You can also define a template file for daily notes. This file will be copied into your Daily note when it's created, so it's a good place to put tags or links you use every day.

You can create a Daily Note either by clicking on the calendar icon in the left panel, or with the [[Command palette]]. You can also set a hotkey in [[Keyboard shortcuts]].
