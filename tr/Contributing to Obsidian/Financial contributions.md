This page explains the ways you can support the development of Obsidian financially.

One of the best ways to support the team is through one or more of our paid products.

- If you need to sync notes across your devices, consider a subscription for [[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]].
- If you want to publish your notes to the world, consider a subscription for [[Introduction to Obsidian Publish|Obsidian Publish]].
- If you use Obsidian for work, we ask you to purchase a [[Commercial license]].

We understand that you might not be interested in any of our paid products right now, though we'd love to know how we can change that! If you still want to support Obsidian and you only use Obsidian for personal purposes, consider getting a [[Catalyst license]].
