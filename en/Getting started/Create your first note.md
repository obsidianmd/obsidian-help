Notes in Obsidian are stored as plain text files. This means your data is durable and not locked into a proprietary format. By writing your notes in plain text, they'll outlive any appâ€”even Obsidian itself.

## Create a new note

To create a new note:

1. Press `Ctrl+N` (or `Cmd+N` on macOS) on your keyboard.
2. Type "Obsidian" as the name of your note and press `Enter`.
3. Copy and paste the following text into your note:

> Obsidian is the private and flexible writing app that adapts to the way you think.

## Formatting text

Obsidian supports [[Basic formatting syntax|Markdown]] syntax to make text bold, italic, and add links and headings.

1. Copy and paste the following text at the top of the Obsidian note:

   > \# Sharpen your thinking.

   The hash symbol (`#`) turns a line of text into a heading.

2. In your note, select any text and press `Ctrl+B` (or `Cmd+B` on macOS) to make it bold.

To learn more about how to format your notes using Markdown, refer to [[Basic formatting syntax]].
