The mobile app aims to provide a familiar user experience for those already using the desktop app.

That being said, there are a few features unique to the mobile app. In this guide, you’ll learn about them to get the most use out of the mobile app.

## Mobile toolbar

Mobile toolbar is a customization toolbar for editing notes.

When editing a note, you will notice a row of icons at the bottom of the app. The default arrangement of actions provides quick access to commonly used functionalities. You can customize them as well.

> [!tip] Scroll the toolbar
> If you have lots of actions on the toolbar, you can swipe left and right on the toolbar to reveal more actions.

### Customize mobile toolbar

In the mobile toolbar, tap **Configure mobile toolbar** ( ![[lucide-wrench.svg#icon]] )  to open the interface to customize it.

Alternatively, you can do it in Settings.

1. Open Settings.
2. Choose **Mobile**.
3. Under **Manage toolbar options**, add, remove, or reorder the available options.

### Add command to mobile toolbar

By default, the options that are available to be added to the toolbar are editing options like "Add internal link" or "Add tag".

In addition to that, you can add global commands like "Change theme".

1. Find **Manage toolbar options** under **Settings** → **Mobile**.
2. Scroll to the very bottom, find **Add global command**.
3. Type the name of the command you wish to add.
4. Select the command you’ll like to add.
5. The new command gets added to the end of the toolbar.

## Quick Action

On the mobile app, you can define one action that gets invoked by pulling down from the top of the app, similar to how you would pull to refresh on social media apps.

Quick Action defaults to open [[Command palette]].

### Customize Quick Action

1. Open Settings.
2. Choose **Mobile**.
3. Under **Configure mobile Quick Action**, tap **Configure**.
4. Type the name of the command.
5. Select the command you’d like to set.
6. Close the setting page.

Now, when you pull down from the top, the new Quick Action will be invoked.

## Navigation bar

The navigation bar on mobile helps you navigate the app. The navigation bar shows up when you’re not editing the app.

With the **Toggle keyboard** toolbar option, you can close the mobile toolbar and switch to the navigation bar instead.

### Go back or forward

On the navigation bar, the first two options helps you go back (back arrow icon) or forward (forward arrow icon). If one of the options is not available, the icon is greyed out.

### Create or find note

The middle plus in circle icon lets you create a new note or switch to an existing note. This is equivalent to opening [[Quick switcher]].

### Tab management

The second icon to the right shows you how many tabs are currently open. The icon looks like a number in a box. For example, the icon below indicates there are two tabs open.

<span class="mobile-navbar-tabs-action">2</span>
When you tap it, you’ll be able to switch to any open tab. You can also open a new tab.

### Ribbon actions

The mobile app has no [[Ribbon]]. Instead, the ribbon actions will be available when you tap **Open menu** ( ![[lucide-menu.svg#icon]] ), the last option on the navigation bar.

### Right sidebar

The right sidebar can be accessed by swiping left either while editing the active note or in the Reading view by holding the triple-dot icon in the upper-right corner.
