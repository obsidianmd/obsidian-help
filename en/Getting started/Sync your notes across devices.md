This guide will help you sync your Obsidian vaults across different devices and platforms. We cover common sync methods by type and platform, including tips for avoiding data loss and ensuring a smooth experience.

We also recommend reading our [[Back up your Obsidian files|backup]] guide alongside this article for the best protection of your data.

## Syncing types

The list of syncing types is not exhaustive, and only covers the most common ones as reported by the [Obsidian Community](https://obsidian.md/community).

1. **First-party syncing**: [[#Obsidian Sync]]
2. **Third-party cloud syncing**: [[#iCloud]], [[#OneDrive]], and [[#Google Drive]]
3. **Local sync**: [[#Syncthing]]
4. **Version control**: [[#Git]] and [[#Working Copy]]

## Obsidian Sync

**Recommended systems**: `Windows`, `macOS`, `Linux`, `iOS`, `Android`

The most straightforward and officially supported method, [[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]], keeps your vaults synced across all devices by using an off-site remote vault to make copies of your data. A local copy will remain on your devices at all times.

Follow the [[Set up Obsidian Sync|setup guide]] to configure it.

> [!Important] Avoid using Obsidian Sync alongside other cloud services like Dropbox or OneDrive **for the same vault**, as this can cause data conflicts and file corruption.

## iCloud

**Recommended systems**: `macOS`, `iOS`, `iPadOS`

iCloud can be used to sync vaults between iOS and macOS. However, **iCloud Drive on Windows** may lead to file duplication or corruption.

**How to create and store your vault in iCloud Drive**:

- **Enable iCloud Drive**:
    - On macOS: Go to **System Preferences → Apple ID → iCloud → iCloud Drive**.
    - On iOS: Go to **Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → iCloud Drive**.
- **Create a new vault in iCloud**:
    - On macOS:
        1. Open **Obsidian** and select **Create new vault**.
        2. In the file picker, navigate to **iCloud Drive → Obsidian**.
        3. Create a folder for your vault and name it.
        4. Select **Create** to finish.
    - On iOS:
        1. Open **Obsidian** and tap **Create new vault**.
        2. Enter a name for your vault.
        3. Toggle on **Store in iCloud**.
        4. Tap **Create**.
- **Open the vault on another Apple device**: 
    - On another macOS or iOS device, open **Obsidian**, go to the [[Manage vaults|Vault switcher]], and select **Open folder as vault**. Navigate to **iCloud Drive → Obsidian**.

> [!Tip] Best Practices
> - For **macOS 14 (Sonoma) and earlier**: Disable **Optimize Mac Storage** in iCloud settings to prevent files from being offloaded. This setting affects all iCloud storage on the device, not just Obsidian.
> - For **macOS 15 (Sequoia)**: Right-click the **Obsidian** folder in iCloud Drive and select **Keep Downloaded**.

## OneDrive

**Recommended systems**: `Windows`, `macOS` (limited functionality on Android)

[OneDrive](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/Sync-with-OneDrive-bb89981b-e382-4969-b8fd-d413a90b6db3#ID0EAABAAA=Set_up) is a popular cloud storage option for Windows and macOS users. However, it has limitations on Android and isn't officially supported for syncing Obsidian vaults on iOS.

> [!Important] Before using OneDrive for syncing, ensure that your vault folder is marked as **Always keep on this device**. This prevents OneDrive from offloading files and causing Obsidian to think they are missing.

**How to create and store your vault in OneDrive**:

1. **Set up OneDrive**:
   - On Windows: Sign in through the OneDrive app or your Microsoft account.
   - On macOS: Download the OneDrive app and sign in.
2. **Create a new vault in OneDrive**:
   - On Windows/macOS:
     1. Open **File Explorer** (Windows) or **Finder** (macOS) and navigate to **OneDrive → Documents**.
     2. Create a new folder (e.g., "Obsidian Vault").
     3. Open **Obsidian**, click **Create new vault**, and select the OneDrive folder.
3. **Open the vault on another device**:
   - On another device, open **Obsidian**, go to the [[Manage vaults|Vault switcher]], and select **Open folder as vault**. Navigate to **OneDrive → Documents**.

> [!Note] OneDrive may not function well for Android syncing. Consider using apps like [Dropsync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.dropsync) or [FolderSync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.tacit.android.foldersync.lite).

> [!Tip] Best Practices:
> - Always keep your vault files **Available Offline** by right-clicking the folder and selecting **Always keep on this device**.
> - Avoid using OneDrive's **Files On-Demand** feature for vaults to prevent syncing issues.

## Google Drive

**Recommended systems**: `Windows`, `macOS`, `Android` (limited functionality on iOS)

[Google Drive](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/10838124?hl=en) is another popular cloud storage solution. Although it's not officially supported for syncing Obsidian vaults, you can use third-party apps and plugins to sync across devices.

> [!Important] Google Drive is not officially supported for syncing Obsidian vaults on iOS. Consider using a third-party solution or plugin to sync on iOS.

**How to create and store your vault in Google Drive**:

1. **Set up Google Drive**:
    - On Windows or macOS: Download the Google Drive app and sign in.
    - On Android: Ensure Google Drive is enabled and signed in.
2. **Create a new vault in Google Drive**:
    - On Windows/macOS:
        1. Open **File Explorer** (Windows) or **Finder** (macOS) and navigate to **Google Drive**.
        2. Create a new folder (e.g., "Obsidian Vault").
        3. Open **Obsidian**, click **Create new vault**, and select the Google Drive folder.
3. **Open the vault on another device**:
    - On another device, open **Obsidian**, go to the [[Manage vaults|Vault switcher]], and select **Open folder as vault**. Navigate to your Google Drive folder.

> [!Tip] Best Practices:
> - Set vault files to **Available Offline** in Google Drive to avoid syncing issues due to offloading.
> - For iOS, consider alternative methods like [[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]], [[#iCloud]], or use the **Remotely Save** plugin.

## Syncthing

**Recommended systems**: `Windows`, `macOS`, `Linux`, `Android`

Syncthing is a decentralized file synchronization tool that doesn't rely on cloud storage. It syncs your vault directly between devices over the network or internet.

**How to create and store your vault using Syncthing**:

1. **Set up Syncthing**:
   - Install Syncthing on each device. Refer to the [Syncthing website](https://syncthing.net/) for installation guides.
2. **Create and configure a shared folder**:
   - On all devices:
     1. Open Syncthing and create a shared folder. Set the folder path to your Obsidian vault.
     2. Ensure the same folder is selected on all devices.
     3. Configure folder syncing preferences (e.g., **Send & Receive** for bidirectional syncing).
3. **Open the vault in Obsidian**:
   - Once the folder is synced across devices, open **Obsidian**, go to the [[Manage vaults|Vault switcher]], and select **Open folder as vault**.

> [!Note] Syncthing works best when at least one device is always on to ensure continuous syncing.

> [!Tip] Best Practices:
> - For local syncing, ensure all devices are connected to the same network.
> - Exclude `.obsidian` from syncing if you want separate settings on each device.
> - Use ignore patterns to avoid syncing temporary or backup files.

## Git

**Recommended systems**: `Windows`, `macOS`, `Linux`

**Git** is a version control system that allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and sync your vaults through repositories like GitHub, GitLab, or a self-hosted server.

**How to sync your vault using Git**:

1. **Set up a remote repository**:
    - Create a repository on a Git hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or a self-hosted server).
2. **Sync your vault**:
    1. Open a terminal or Git GUI (e.g., GitKraken, Sourcetree).
    2. Initialize a Git repository in your vault folder using `git init`.
    3. Add the remote repository: `git remote add origin [URL]`.
    4. Commit your changes: `git add .` and `git commit -m "Your message"`.
    5. Push the changes: `git push origin main`.
3. **Pull changes on other devices**:
    - Clone the repository on another device and pull changes using `git pull origin main`.

> [!Note] Git provides strong version control, but syncing isn't automatic. You must manually push and pull changes.

## iPhone and iPad syncing

**Recommended options**:
- [[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]]
- [[#iCloud]]

> [!Important] Avoid syncing the same vault across multiple services (e.g., using both Obsidian Sync and iCloud simultaneously) to prevent data conflicts or corruption.

**Unsupported options**:
The following services aren't officially supported on iOS, but users have found workarounds using third-party tools or plugins:
- Dropbox
- Google Drive
- OneDrive
- Syncthing

Some users have successfully used plugins like **Remotely Save** or **LiveSync** to sync vaults on iOS. However, these methods aren't officially supported, and results may vary.

### Working Copy

**Recommended systems**: `iOS`
**Requires**: [[#Git]]

**Working Copy** is a Git client for iOS that allows you to clone, commit, and push changes to a Git repository. It works well for syncing Obsidian vaults via Git, though some features require a paid in-app purchase.

**How to sync your vault using Working Copy**:

1. **Install Working Copy**:
    - Download the **[Working Copy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807)** app on your iPhone or iPad.
2. **Clone your Git repository**:
    - Open Working Copy, tap **Add Repository**, and enter your repository URL (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
3. **Link repository to Obsidian**:
    - Link the cloned repository folder to an empty vault in **Obsidian**.
4. **Commit and push changes**:
    - After editing notes in Obsidian, use Working Copy to **Commit** and **Push** changes to the remote repository.
    - On other devices, pull changes using Git to sync the vault.

> [!Note] While Working Copy isn't officially supported, many users have successfully used it to sync vaults with Git.

## Frequently asked questions

**Why is my preferred syncing service not officially supported?**

Unlike some note-taking apps that access one file at a time, Obsidian requires access to the entire vault for its features (e.g., updating links when renaming a file). This makes it difficult for some services to function reliably with Obsidian.

**Why do I need to keep files "Available Offline"?**

If services like OneDrive or iCloud offload files (e.g., using **Files On-Demand** or **Optimize Mac Storage**), Obsidian can't access them, causing sync issues. Mark your vault folder as **Always keep on this device** (OneDrive) or ensure **Keep Downloaded** is enabled (iCloud).

**How do I manage different configurations for my vaults?**

Obsidian allows you to customize the configuration folder per device using the [[Configuration folder|Customization/Config folders]] feature.
