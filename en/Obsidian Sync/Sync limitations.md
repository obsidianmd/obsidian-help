### Is my data being synced in the background?

### What's the maximum number of people I can share a remote vault with?

## Data retention
 
These are commonly asked questions on Obsidian's data retention. For more in depth answers, see [[Obsidian Sync/Security and privacy|Security and privacy]].

### How long do you keep the version history?

Older [[Version history|versions]] of Markdown files are stored for one year, and then deleted. 

Older versions of [[Attachments|attachments]] are stored for two weeks.

### How long do you keep my data after my subscription expires?

We keep data in your remote vaults, including version history, for one month after your subscription expires. Any local vaults on your devices are unaffected.

As long as you renew within one month, there should be no impact on your usage. If you renew after a month, when your remote vaults have been removed, you can [[Set up Obsidian Sync|create a new remote vault]] and connect your local vault.

### Do you keep my data if I refund my subscription service?

No. The data is deleted immediately from Obsidian Sync servers. Data in your [[Local and remote vaults|local vault]] is not affected.
