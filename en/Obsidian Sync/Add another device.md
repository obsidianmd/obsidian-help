In this guide, you'll create a local vault on another device to sync with your remote vault. This will keep the local vaults on all your devices in sync.

## Prerequisites

You need to have [[set up Obsidian Sync]] on at least one device and have created a remote vault on Obsidian Sync.

You also need to create an empty vault on this device before connecting to Obsidian Sync, like so:

![[Create a vault#Create empty vault]]

> [!tip] Obsidian URIs
> If you’d like Obsidian URIs to work across advice, you give your vaults the same name on all devices.

![[Set up Obsidian Sync#Step 1 Log in with your Obsidian account]]

![[Set up Obsidian Sync#Step 2 Enable Obsidian Sync]]


## Step 3: Connect to a remote vault

1. Open **Settings**.
2. In the sidebar, click **Sync**.
3. Next to **Pick remote vault**, click **Choose**.
4. Click **Connect** next to the remote vault you want to connect to. 
	   If the the vault on your current device already contains some notes (not recommended), you will warned that those notes will me merged before proceeding. 
 5.  In **Encryption password**, enter the password for your vault if you have one.

Once you have connected to the remote vault, you can choose to [[Select files and settings to sync|tweak which files and settings to sync]].
