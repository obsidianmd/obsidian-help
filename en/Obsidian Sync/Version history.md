[[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]] keeps a record of all changes made to your notes. Sync regularly checks for updates and creates new versions of your notes. This information is available to you through several methods:

- [[#Sync history]]
- [[#Version history]]

## Sync history

The Sync history (or Sync sidebar) feature, introduced in Obsidian version 1.7, allows you to quickly view recently created or modified notes and attachments that have been synced. You can also think of it as an _editing_ history.

In the sidebar, you can select an item to open its file in your active window. The items also have context menus, allowing you to perform actions such as moving the file or viewing its [[#Notes and attachments|Version history]].

> [!compatibility] Desktop-only feature
> When you hover over a synced file in the sidebar, you can see who last edited the file. This is especially useful if you are [[Collaborate on a shared vault|collaborating]] on a shared vault.

> [!tip] 
> Settings and deleted items will not appear in the Sync history sidebar. These can be found in the [[#Notes and attachments|Version history]] instead.

### Show Sync history

When you enable the [[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Sync]] core plugin, Sync history is automatically enabled but does not appear in the sidebar by default. You will need to manually add it using a command or a hotkey.

#### Enable via Command palette

> [!info] This option requires the [[Command palette]] core plugin to be enabled.

**Desktop/Tablet** ![[lucide-monitor-check.svg#icon]]

1. Open the **Command palette**. ( ![[lucide-terminal.svg#icon]] )
2. Type "Sync".
3. Select the "Sync: Show Sync history" option.

Sync history will then appear in the [[Sidebar|right sidebar]].

**Mobile** ![[obsidian-smartphone.svg#icon]]

1. Open the [[Ribbon]] ( ![[lucide-menu.svg#icon]] ).
2. Open the **Command palette**. ( ![[lucide-terminal.svg#icon]] )
3. Type "Sync".
4. Select the "Sync: Show Sync history" option.

Sync history will then appear as a dropdown option in the [[Sidebar|right sidebar]].

#### Enable via Hotkey

1. Open **Settings**.
2. In the **Options** category, select **Hotkeys**.
3. In the hotkeys search bar, type "Sync".
4. Next to "Sync: Show Sync history," assign your preferred hotkey.

## Version history

In addition to the [[#Sync history]], Obsidian also maintains a version history for restoring notes and attachments. If you accidentally delete a note or want to revert to a previous version, you can restore it from the version history.

The retention period for your version history depends on your [[Plans and storage limits|Obsidian Sync plan]]. On the Standard plan, notes are retained for 1 month, while on the Plus plan, they are kept for 12 months. After this period, older versions of your notes are deleted. 

For [[Attachments|attachments]], older versions are stored for <u>two weeks</u>.
