This page lists common errors that you might encounter, and what they mean.

## What does the `vault limit exceeded` error mean?

Your vault exceeds the [[Limitations#How large can each remote vault be|maximum size of 10 GB]].

Since attachments and version history contributes to the total size of your vault, your vault can exceed the maximum size even if the actual size of your vault is less than the limit.

To identify and purge large files from the vault:

1. Open **Preferences** -> **Sync**.
2. Explore the options under **Vault size over limit** for how you can reduce the size of your vault.
