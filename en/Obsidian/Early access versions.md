Get early access to upcoming releases by enabling _early access versions_. Early access versions are only available to users with a [[Catalyst license]].

> [!warning]
> Early access versions are beta releases. They include new features but may be less stable. Don't enable early access versions if you prefer a more reliable experience.
> 
> Be aware that community plugin and theme developers receive early access versions at the same time as everyone else. Be patient with developers who need to make updates to support new features.
