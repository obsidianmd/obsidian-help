Unique note creator lets you create notes with time-based names, also known as Zettelkasten notes.

For example, if you create a new note at 09:45 on Jan 1st, 2024, Unique note creator creates a note with `202401010945` as its name. If a note with the same name exists, the new note uses the next available timestamp.

## Create a unique note

**Ribbon:**

- In the ribbon, click **Create new unique note** ( ![[obsidian-sheets-in-box.svg#icon]] ).

**Command palette:**

1. Press `Ctrl+P` (or `Cmd+P` on macOS) to open the [[Command palette]].
2. Search for the **Create new unique note** command.
3. Press `Enter` with the command selected.

## Create unique notes from a template

By default, new unique notes are empty. To use another file as a template:

- Open **Settings**.
- In the sidebar, click **Core plugins → Unique note creator**.
- In **Template file location**, enter the file you want to use as template.

For more information about how to write templates, refer to [[Templates]].
