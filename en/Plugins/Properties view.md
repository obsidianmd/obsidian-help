The Properties view plugin adds two sidebar views that you can use to manage [[Properties]]:

- **File properties** shows a view of the properties for the active note.
- **All properties** shows a list of all the properties in your vault and their type.

## All properties view

With the "All properties" view you can:

- Sort properties by name or by frequency (total number of uses in your vault).
- Click a property to open [[Search]] view with the [[Search#Search properties|property search]] syntax pre-filled.
- Right-click a property to rename it globally.
