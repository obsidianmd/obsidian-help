Canvas is a tool for visual note-taking. Lay out notes and other resources on an infinite canvas and connect them with lines.

Visual note-taking allows you to use visual aspects, such as size and position, to make sense of your notes. Connect notes with lines and group related notes together to better understand the relationship between them.

## Create a new canvas

To start using Canvas, you first need to create a file to hold your canvas. You can create a new canvas using the following methods.

**Ribbon:**

- In the ribbon on the left, select **Create new canvas** ( ![[lucide-layout-dashboard.svg#icon]] ) to create a canvas in the same folder as the active file.

**Command palette:**

1. Open the [[Command palette]].
2. Select **Canvas: Create new canvas** to create a canvas in the same folder as the active file.

**File explorer:**

- In the [[File explorer]], right-click the folder you want to create the canvas in.
- Select **New canvas**.

> [!note]  The .canvas file extension
> Obsidian stores your canvas data as `.canvas` files using an open file format called [JSON Canvas](https://jsoncanvas.org/).

## Adding cards

You can drag files into your canvas from Obsidian or from other applications. For example, Markdown files, images, audio, PDFs, or even unrecognized file types.

### Add text cards

You can add text-only cards that don't reference a file. You can use Markdown, links, and code blocks just like in a note.

You can also add text cards by double-clicking on the canvas.

To convert a text card to a file:

1. Right-click the text card and then select **Convert to file...**.
