Page preview lets you preview a page when you hover the cursor over an internal link, without needing to navigate to that page.

By default, hovering over a link will preview that file in [[File explorer]], [[Search]], [[Backlinks]], and more. To preview a page while in Editing view, press `Ctrl` (or `Cmd` on macOS) while hovering the cursor over the link.

There is also an option to require `Ctrl` (or `Cmd` on macOS) while hovering to see the file. The settings for this option are under Core plugins > Page preview.

> [!hint]
> Preview is **on by default**. Toggling the plugin option will **turn the behavior off**.
