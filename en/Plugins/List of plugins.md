One of the most powerful aspects of Obsidian is the ability to add new functionality via plugins. It comes with several already, and many more are in development. Eventually, you will be able to build your own.

Plugins can be managed through the "Settings" button on the bottom left. Some of them have settings of their own that can be configured by clicking on the gear that appears next to each plugin when it is activated.
