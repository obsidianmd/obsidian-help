## Open Quick switcher

There are several ways to open Quick Switcher, when it's enabled:
- Press `Ctrl+O` (or `Cmd+O` on macOS) to open the Quick switcher;
- In the ribbon, click **Open Quick switcher** ( ![[lucide-file-search.svg#icon]] );
- On mobile, when you're not editing a note, tap the plus icon at bottom center of the app.

If the text doesn't match any notes, you can press `Enter` to create a note with that name. Even if the text matches one or more similar notes, you can still create a note with the exact name by pressing `Shift+Enter`.

You can open the selected note in a new tab by pressing `Ctrl+Enter` (or `Cmd+Enter` on macOS).
