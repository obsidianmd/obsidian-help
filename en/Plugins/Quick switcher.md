The Quick switcher lets you search and open notes using only your keyboard. 

To open a note using the Quick switcher:

1. Press Ctrl+O (or Cmd+O on macOS) to open the Quick switcher.
1. Type to search for a note.
1. Navigate to the note using the arrow keys.
1. Press Enter to open the selected note.

If the text doesn't match any notes, you can press Enter to create a note with that name. Even if the text matches one or more similar notes, you can still create a note with the exact name by pressing Shift+Enter.

You can open the selected note in a new pane by pressing Ctrl+Enter (or Cmd+Enter on macOS).

> [!tip] Toggle between two notes
> If the search term is empty, the Quick switcher shows the most recent notes. Toggle between two notes by opening the Quick switter, pressing the Down arrow, and then pressing Enter.
