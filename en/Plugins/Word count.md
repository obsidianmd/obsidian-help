Word count is a [[Core plugins|core plugin]] that displays the number of words and characters of the active note.

On desktop word count appears in the [[status bar]]. On mobile, word count appears at the top of the right sidebar.

Word count supports CJK languages (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), which don't use spaces to separate words.
