Bookmarks let you quickly access items that you use often. A bookmark is a "shortcut" that immediately takes you the bookmarked item.

You can add bookmarks to the following:

- Files
- Folders
- Graphs
- Searches
- Headings
- Blocks

Open a bookmark by selecting it in the Bookmarks tab.

You can reorder bookmarks by selecting and dragging them.

You can bookmark items and organize them into _bookmark groups_ to find them easier. You can expand and collapse bookmark groups to show or hide the bookmarks in them.

> [!todo]- Show bookmarks
> You can find your bookmarked items by clicking **Bookmarks** ( ![[lucide-bookmark.svg#icon]] ) in the left sidebar.
>
> Or, open the Bookmarks tab by running **Bookmarks: Show bookmarks** from the [[Command palette]].
