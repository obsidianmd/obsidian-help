description: Create database-like views of your notes, formatted as tables or cards. Edit, sort, and filter files using their properties.
---
Bases is a [[Core plugins|core plugin]] that lets you create database-like views of your notes. Using a base you can view, edit, sort, and filter files and their [[Properties|properties]]. Bases can help you organize everything from projects to travel plans, reading lists, and more.

Each base can have several [[Views|views]] with different layouts such as tables and cards. Below is an example of table view where each row is a file, and each column is a property of that file.

All the data in Obsidian Bases is stored in your local [[Basic formatting syntax|Markdown]] files and their [[properties]]. The views are described by the [[Bases syntax]], which can be saved as a `.base` file or [[Create a base#Embed a base|embedded]] in code blocks within your Markdown files.
