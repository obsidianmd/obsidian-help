The [[Introduction to Bases|Bases]] plugin is still in beta. We expect many changes and improvements to Bases over the coming months, and a longer than usual [[Early access versions|early access]] phase.

Some planned features include:

- Bases API for plugins to add more power through custom functions and new view types.
- More view types beyond tables, e.g. list, cards, etc.
- Grouping files and aggregation functions (e.g. sum, average, etc).
- Obsidian Publish support.
