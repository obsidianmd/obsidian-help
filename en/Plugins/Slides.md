Slides lets you create presentations from your notes. To start a presentation:

**File menu:**

- Right-click the tab of a note and click **Start presentation**.

**Command palette:**

1. Press `Ctrl+P` (or `Cmd+P` on macOS) to open the [[Command palette]].
2. Search for the **Start presentation** command.
3. Press `Enter` with the command selected to start a presentation using the active note.

To navigate between slides, click the left and right arrows in the bottom-right corner, or press the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard.

You can also advance to the next slide by pressing Spacebar.

To stop the presentation, press `Escape` or click the cross in the upper-right corner of the presentation.

You can use any valid Markdown file as a presentation. To separate slides, enter `---` at the start of a line surrounded by newlines.
