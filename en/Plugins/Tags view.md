Tags view lists all tags within your vault along with how many notes that contain them.

Click a tag to search for it using [[Search]].

To toggle a tag in the search query, click the tag while pressing `Ctrl` (or `Cmd` on macOS).

The plugin provides the following options:

- **Change sort order** determines whether to sort the tags by **Tag name** or **Frequency**.
- **Show nested tags** toggles whether to display nested tags as a tree or as a flat list.
- **Expand all** and **Collapse all** expands and collapses the nested tags hierarchy.

You can choose to expand or collapse each nested level separately by clicking the arrow next to it.
