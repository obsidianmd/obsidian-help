The Outgoing links plugin shows the links from the active note at a glance, as well as potential links to be made. It's similar to the [[Backlinks]] plugin, which instead shows you _incoming_ links to the active note.

The Outgoing links tab ( ![[obsidian-links-going-out.svg#icon]] ) is available in the right sidebar and contains the following sections:

- **Links** lists all links in the active note. Click a link to open the linked note.
- **Unlinked mentions** lists any text in the active note that matches the name or [[Aliases|alias]] of another note in your vault. Unlinked mentions helps you discover links you aren't aware of yet.

To create a link from an unlinked mention, click the button with the note's name.

> [!tip]
> Unlinked mentions can refer to different notes with the same name. To show the full path of the note, hover over the button with the note's name.

> [!note] Code blocks
> While you can create a link from an unlinked mention inside a code block, due to the nature of code blocks, links don't show up under the Links section.
