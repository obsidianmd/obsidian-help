Once you install the [[Introduction to Obsidian Web Clipper|Web Clipper]] browser extension, you can access it in several ways, depending on your browser:

1. The Obsidian icon in your browser toolbar.
2. Hotkeys, to activate the extension from your keyboard.
3. Context menu, by right-clicking the web page you are visiting.

To save a page to Obsidian click the **Add to Obsidian** button.

## Capture a page

When you open the extension, Web Clipper extracts data from the current web page following the settings in your [[Obsidian Web Clipper/Templates|template]]. You can create your own templates, and customize the output using [[variables]] and [[filters]].

By default Web Clipper attempts to intelligently extract only the main article content, excluding other elements on the page. However, you can override this behavior in the following ways:

- If a custom template is present it uses your template.
- If a selection is present, it uses the selection. You can use `Ctrl/Cmd+A` to select the entire page.
- If any [[Highlight web pages|highlights]] are present, it uses the highlights.

## Hotkeys

Web Clipper includes keyboard shortcuts you can use to speed up your workflow. To change key mappings go to **Web Clipper Settings** â†’ **General** and follow the instructions for your browser. Mappings can be changed for all browsers except Safari which does not support editing hotkeys.
