Once you install the [[Introduction to Obsidian Web Clipper|Web Clipper]] browser extension, you can access it in several ways, depending on your browser:

1. The Obsidian icon in your browser toolbar.
2. Hotkeys, to activate the extension from your keyboard.
3. Context menu, by right-clicking the web page you are visiting.

To save a page to Obsidian click the **Add to Obsidian** button.

## Capture a page

When you open the extension, Web Clipper extracts data from the current web page following the settings in your [[Obsidian Web Clipper/Templates|template]]. You can create your own templates, and customize the output using [[variables]] and [[filters]].

By default Web Clipper attempts to intelligently extract only the main article content, excluding other elements on the page. However, you can override this behavior in the following ways:

- If a custom template is present it uses your template.
- If a selection is present, it uses the selection. You can use `Ctrl/Cmd+A` to select the entire page.
- If any [[Highlight web pages|highlights]] are present, it uses the highlights.

## Download images

Images are not automatically downloaded when you use Web Clipper. Instead, images link to their web-based URL. This saves space in your vault but it means the images will not be accessible offline, or if the URL stops working.

You can download images for any file in Obsidian using the [[Command palette|command]] named **Download attachments for current file**. This command can also be mapped to a hotkey in Obsidian.

## Hotkeys

Web Clipper includes keyboard shortcuts you can use to speed up your workflow. To change key mappings go to **Web Clipper Settings** → **General** and follow the instructions for your browser. Mappings can be changed for all browsers except Safari which does not support editing hotkeys.

The Web Clipper interface is divided into four sections:
