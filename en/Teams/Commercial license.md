## Frequently asked questions

**Can I buy a license for myself, or do I have to ask my company to buy it for me?**
Yes. You can buy a license for yourself by going to your [Account dashboard](https://obsidian.md/account/commercial). Most companies allow you to submit an expense report for the purchase.

Some companies may have a different procurement process. Reach out to your IT department to determine their specific procedures. 

**What business name should I use if I'm purchasing the license myself?**
Use your company's name for the license if you expect to be reimbursed by your company. 

Otherwise, use your legal name as the business name.

**Can I purchase a commercial license for multiple employees?**
Yes. You can purchase multiple commercial license seats through your [Account dashboard](https://obsidian.md/account/commercial). There is no need for each employee to have their own Obsidian account, you can use a single admin account to purchase all the seats.

After purchasing the license, you will receive a license key which you can send to employees to activate their license — see instructions above to activate the license.

**Am I required to purchase a commercial license for every employee?**
No. Obsidian is 100% free to use and so there is no minimum seat count purchase required. 

**Can I use the commercial license I purchased on both my work phone and work computer?**
Yes. The commercial license is charged per seat count, not per device. This means you can use the same license key on all your individual work devices.

**I work in a highly secure environment, in an air-gapped network. How do I apply my commercial license?**
In such specialized environments, you don't need to apply the commercial license directly to your installation.
