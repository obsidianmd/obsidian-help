If you use Obsidian for work in a company with **two or more** employees, you must purchase a Commercial license. The details of licensing Obsidian can be found in our [terms of service](https://obsidian.md/terms).

You and your team can use Obsidian for free for **14 days** to evaluate the app for commercial use before you purchase.

For questions about bulk discounts for seat licenses, contact [[Help and support#Contact Obsidian support|Obsidian support]].

## What is considered commercial use?

Commercial use includes, but isn't limited to, work-related activities such as:

- Meeting notes
- Project notes for teams
- Organizational wikis
- Tasks lists

> [!tip] A rule of thumb for determining commercial use is: if the contents of a note would be placed in a shredder box if they were on paper, then that note is considered commercial use.

You don't need a Commercial license if you work in any of the following settings:

- Schools and recognized educational institutions
- Non-commercial research
- Registered non-profit organizations
- Freelancing or companies with a single person

Government departments and agencies are classified as commercial use unless registered as a non-profit organization.

## Frequently asked questions

### Do I need a commercial license?

**Do non-profit organizations require a commercial license?**
No. Registered non-profit organizations may use Obsidian without a commercial license.

**I'm a writer/blogger, do I need a commercial license?**
If your writing is for-profit — for example you write for a blog that generates revenue via ads or sponsorships — and your business employs more than one person, then yes, you need a commercial license.

**I'm a solo freelancer/consultant, but my work indirectly contributes to "revenue-generating, work-related activities in a company that has two or more people". Do I need a commercial license?**
No. As long as you are the sole employee of your freelance/consulting business, you don't need a commercial license.

**I'm a teacher/professor, or I work at a school, and I use Obsidian for my teaching/lectures. Do I need a commercial license?**
No. Obsidian usage for education-related activities within schools and other recognized educational institutions doesn't require a commercial license.

**I'm an academic researcher and I use Obsidian for my research work. Do I need a commercial license?**
If your research involves producing a commercial product — for example if your research contributes to revenue-generating commercial activities — you need a commercial license for your usage. 

If your research doesn't contribute to a commercial product, or if your research has not yet led to commercial activities, you don't need a license.

**I work for a government or an arm's length body or agency. Do I need a commercial license?**
Yes. Government agencies and departments need a commercial license. Registered charitable and non-profit organizations are exempted.

**I use Obsidian during work for things like writing down team processes and taking notes for team meetings. Do I need a commercial license?**
If you are a single-person company, then you don't require a commercial license. If your company has more than one employee, then yes, you need a commercial license.

**I use Obsidian to store all of my knowledge, both personal and professional, because it's difficult to separate them. Do I need a commercial license?**
If your notes contain content directly related to work projects or processes for a company with more than one employee, then yes, you need a commercial license.

**I'm still not sure if I need a commercial license. What should I do?**
If you still have questions regarding the commercial license requirements, contact [[Help and support#Contact Obsidian support|Obsidian support]] and describe your situation in detail.

### Purchasing process

**Can I try Obsidian for commercial use before paying?**
Yes. You and your team may evaluate Obsidian for commercial use for **14** days. You don't need to pay before evaluating.

**Are there bulk discounts?**
Yes. If you are purchasing 21 or more seats, you may be eligible for bulk pricing. Please contact [[Help and support#Contact Obsidian support|Obsidian support]].

**Can I buy a license for myself, or do I have to ask my company to buy it for me?**
Yes. You can buy a license for yourself by going to your [Account dashboard](https://obsidian.md/account/commercial). Most companies allow you to submit an expense report for the purchase.

Some companies may have a different procurement process. Ask your IT department to contact [[Help and support#Contact Obsidian support|Obsidian support]] if they have questions or require specific paperwork.

**What business name should I use if I'm purchasing the license myself?**
Use your company's name for the license if you expect to be reimbursed by your company. 

Otherwise, use your legal name as the business name.

**Can I purchase a commercial license for multiple employees?**
Yes. You can purchase multiple commercial license seats through your [Account dashboard](https://obsidian.md/account/commercial). There is no need for each employee to have their own Obsidian account, you can use a single admin account to purchase all the seats.

After purchasing the license, you will receive a license key which you can send to employees to activate their license — see instructions above to activate the license.

### Applying the license

**Can I use the commercial license I purchased on both my work phone and work computer?**
Yes. The commercial license is charged per seat count, not per device. This means you can use the same license key on all your individual work devices.

**I work in a highly secure environment, in an air-gapped network. How do I apply my commercial license?**
In such specialized environments, you don't need to apply the commercial license directly to your installation. However, you must monitor license usage and retain relevant records to ensure compliance with our [terms of service](https://obsidian.md/terms).
