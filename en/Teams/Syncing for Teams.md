Obsidian is designed to work both online and offline and give you total control over your team's data. To share data across your team, you will need to choose a sync solution.

## Syncing tools and services

Obsidian offers an official service called [[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]] which provides end-to-end encrypted syncing for small teams up to 20 users.

Because Obsidian stores your data in plain text `.md` files, there are numerous options available to [[Sync your notes across devices|sync data across devices]] and control access to your team's data. This can include version control systems such as Git, network attached storage systems, and many services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and more.

## Obsidian Sync for teams

With [[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]] you can collaborate on a shared vault with your team. 

All collaborators **must have an active Sync subscription** to access a shared vault. Joining a shared vault does not count towards your [[Plans and storage limits#Plans|remote vault limit]]. Note that Obsidian Sync is not included with the [[Commercial license]] and must be purchased separately.

If the remote vault is [[Obsidian Sync/Security and privacy#Encryption|end-to-end encrypted]], collaborators must enter the encryption password when they first access the shared remote vault.

## Frequently asked questions

**Can I purchase one Sync subscription and use it for my team?**
If you are a team of one person, yes, you can use the Sync subscription for that team member. However, if you have multiple team members, each member will need their own Obsidian Sync subscription to access and share remote vaults.

**Do you have an on-premises Sync server?**
Obsidian Sync does not have an on-premises solution at this time. Feel free to add your use case to [this feature request](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-sync-self-hosted-server/20975) thread.
