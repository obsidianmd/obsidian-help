This page details some of the considerations a team of people may have when using Publish.

For more information on setting up your Publish site and general considerations, please review [[Introduction to Obsidian Publish]] and [[Publish limitations]].

## Collaboration management

First, please read our guide on how to [[Collaborate on a Publish site]]. This will answer most basic questions, and will be appropriate for very small teams.

If you are a larger team, the default collaboration options in Obsidian Publish may not be scalable enough for proper version control (VCS). While we strongly recommend using [[Back up your Obsidian files|backups]] for your content, the day-to-day management of changes for Publish collaboration is not as fully functional as a service like Git.

You will need to combine Publish with an external VCS, or use it in conjunction with a syncing service like [[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]] to smooth the process of updating changes between multiple users. For example, this documentation is merged together on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-help) and then the contents are published in Obsidian to the Publish site.

## Media

Publish is designed to primarily take plain text files, and some images, and make them available on a website for others to view. Because Obsidian achieves this using part of the same code as the application's [[Edit and preview Markdown#Editor views|reading view]], it is not designed with very high quality media in mind, such as large high-resolution galleries, image hosting, etc. Rather, it aims to be as speedy and lightweight as possible.

Due to its use of the same code as the application's [[Edit and preview Markdown#Editor views|reading view]], Obsidian Publish is not intended for high-quality media, such as large high-resolution galleries or image hosting. Instead, it prioritizes speed and lightweight functionality.
