Learn how to link to notes, attachments, and other files from your notes, using _internal links_. By linking notes, you can create a network of knowledge. ^b15695

Obsidian can automatically update internal links in your vault when you rename a file. If you want to be prompted instead, you can disable it under: 

**Settings → Files & Links → Automatically update internal links**.

## Supported formats for internal links

Obsidian supports the following link formats:

- Wikilink: `[[Three laws of motion]]`
- Markdown: `[Three laws of motion](Three%20laws%20of%20motion.md)`

The examples above are equivalent—they appear the same way in the editor, and links to the same note.

> [!note]
> When using the Markdown format, make sure to [URL encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) the link destination. For example, blank spaces become `%20`.

By default, due to its more compact format, Obsidian generates links using the Wikilink format. If interoperability is important to you, you can disable Wikilinks and use Markdown links instead.

To use the Markdown format:

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Under **Files & Links**, disable **Use \[\[Wikilink\]\]**.

Even if you disable the Wikilink format, you can still autocomplete links by typing two square brackets `[[`. When you select one of the suggested files, Obsidian instead generates a Markdown link.

## Link to a file

To create a link while in Editing view, use either of the following ways:

- Type `[[` in the editor and then select the file you want to create a link to.
- Select text in the editor and then type `[[`.
- Open the [[Command palette]] and then select **Add internal link**.

![[Quick switcher#^search-autocomplete-large]]

While you can link to any of the [[Accepted file formats]], links to file formats other than Markdown needs to include a file extension, such as `[[Figure 1.png]]`.

> [!tip] Prefixing an internal link with an exclamation mark (!) allows you to embed the linked content. For more details, see [[Embed Files]].

## Link to a heading in a note

You can link to specific headings in notes, also known as _anchor links_.

**Linking to a heading within the same note**

To link to a heading within the same note, type `[[#` to get a list of headings within the note to link to.

For example, `[[#Preview a linked file]]` will create a link to [[#Preview a linked file]].

**Linking to a heading in another note**

To link to a heading in another note, add a hash (`#`) at the end of the link destination, followed by the heading text.

For example, `[[Obsidian#Links are first-class citizens]]` will create a link to [[Obsidian#Links are first-class citizens]].

**Linking to subheadings**

You can add multiple hash symbols for each subheading.

For example, `[[Help and support#Questions and advice#Report bugs and request features]]` will create a link to [[Help and support#Questions and advice#Report bugs and request features]].

**Searching for headers across the vault**

To search for headers across the entire vault, use the `[[## header]]` syntax.

For example, `[[##` will search generically across the vault, whereas `[[## team]]` will search for all headers that contain the word _team_.

## Link to a block in a note

A block is a unit of text in your note, such as a paragraph, block quote, or list item.

You can link to a block by adding `#^` at the end of your link destination, followed by a unique block identifier. For example: `[[2023-01-01#^37066d]]`. Fortunately, you don't need to manually find the identifier—when you type the caret (`^`), a list of suggestions will appear, allowing you to select the correct block.

For *simple paragraphs*, place the block identifier at the **end of the line**:

```md
The quick purple gem dashes through the paragraph with blazing speed. Pen in hand and a paperclip in the other, Gemmy works toward her goal of making the world of note-taking a happier place. ^37066d
```

For *structured blocks* (lists, quotations, callouts, tables), the block identifier should be on a **separate line**, with a blank line before and after:

```md
> The quick purple gem dashes through the paragraph with blazing speed. Pen in hand and a paperclip in the other, Gemmy works toward her goal of making the world of note-taking a happier place.

^37066f

This is the tale of Gemmy, the Unhelpful assistant.  
```

For *specific lines within a list*, the block identifier can be placed directly on a bullet point:

```mathjax
- Gemmy
    $$Paperclip / Pen$$ 
    ^37006f
- Unhelpful assistant
```

**Searching for blocks across the vault**

You can also search for blocks to link to from across your vault using the `[[^^block]]` syntax. However, more items qualify as blocks compared to [[#Link to a heading in a note|heading links]], so this list will be much longer.

> [!info]- Screenshot of searching for a block link 
> ![[link-block-heading.png#interface]]

You can also create human-readable block identifiers by adding a blank space followed by the identifier. Block identifiers can only consist of Latin letters, numbers, and dashes.

For example, add `^quote-of-the-day` at the end of a block:

```md
"You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems." by James Clear ^quote-of-the-day
```

Now you can link to the block by typing `[[2023-01-01#^quote-of-the-day]]`.

> [!warning] Interoperability
> Block references are specific to Obsidian and not part of the standard Markdown format. Links containing block references won't work outside of Obsidian.

## Change the link display text

By default, Obsidian will show the link text as it appears, such as `[[Aliases]]` showing [[Aliases]] and `[[Basic formatting syntax#Code blocks]]` showing [[Basic formatting syntax#Code blocks]].

You have the option to modify the text used for displaying a link by using the `[[Aliases|Nicknames]]` and `[[Basic formatting syntax#Code blocks|Code blocks]]` syntaxes to create the [[Aliases|Nicknames]] and [[Basic formatting syntax#Code blocks|Code blocks]] links.

**Wikilink format:**

You can use the vertical bar (`|`) to change the text used to display a link.

For example, `[[Internal links|custom display text]]` appears as [[Internal links|custom display text]].

**Markdown format:**

Enter the display text between the square brackets (`[]`).

For example, `[custom display text](Internal%20links.md)` appears as [custom display text](Internal%20links.md).

## Preview a linked file

> [!note]
> To preview linked files, you first need to enable [[Page preview]].

To preview a linked file, press `Ctrl` (or `Cmd` on macOS) while hovering the cursor over the link. A preview of the file content appears next to the cursor.
