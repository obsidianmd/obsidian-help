You can manage files and folders in several ways, using [[Hotkeys]], [[Command palette|commands]], or [[File explorer]].

## Create a new note

To create a new file:

1. Press `Ctrl+N` (or `Cmd+N` on macOS).
2. Enter the name of the note and then press `Enter` to start editing the note.

You can also create notes using [[File explorer#Create a new note|File explorer]], or by selecting **Create new note** from the [[Command palette]].

## Rename a note

To rename an active note:

1. Select the name of the note at the top of the editor (or press `F2`).
2. Enter the new name and then press `Enter`.

When you rename a file, Obsidian automatically updates all the links to that file.

You can rename a note or folder without opening it, by using [[File explorer#Rename a file or folder|File explorer]]

## Delete a note

To delete a note, select **More options → Delete file** at the upper right of an active note.

Or, select **Delete current file** from the [[Command palette]].

You can also delete a note or folder, using the [[File explorer#Delete a file or folder|File explorer]].
