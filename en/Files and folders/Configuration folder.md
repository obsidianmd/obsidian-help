Obsidian's configuration folder contains all the settings files pertaining to your [[Manage vaults|vault]].

By default, your configuration folder is named `.obsidian` and placed in the vault folder. When using a syncing service, or if you wish to test different profiles in the same vault, you may want to change your config folder. 

## Changing your configuration folder

To set your config folder:

1. Open **Settings → Files and Links**.
2. In **Override config folder**, type the name of your profile, starting with a period (`.`). For example, `.obsidian-awesome`.
3. Relaunch Obsidian to have the changes take effect. 

> [!info] Any settings within your config folder will not transfer to your new config folder. However, your prior config folder will remain within your vault folder.
