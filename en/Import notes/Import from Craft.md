Obsidian allows you to migrate your notes from Craft. This will convert your Craft data to durable Markdown files, that you can use with Obsidian and many other apps.

## Export your data from Craft

Open the Craft app on your desktop computer:

1. Go to the "Organize", or "All Documents" view
2. Click on the three-dot menu
3. Select the Export option.
4. Choose Markdown.

Depending on the number of notes you have in Craft, this process may take a while.

## Import your Craft data into Obsidian

From here you can follow the [[Import Markdown files]] instructions.

## Troubleshooting

Craft Docs uses non-standard syntax for certain links. You can find resources to migrate those on the [Importer GitHub repo](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-importer/issues/27).
