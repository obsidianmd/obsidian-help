Obsidian uses Markdown `.md` files as the primary format for notes. This makes it easy to import Markdown files into Obsidian. Many apps can edit Markdown files or export to this format.

There are several ways to add Markdown files to your Obsidian vault:

1. Drag and drop files or folders into the [[File explorer]] window
2. Use your system file browser (e.g. Windows Explorer or Finder on macOS), and move your files directly into the Obsidian vault folder.

### Converting from other flavors of Markdown

Obsidian uses [[Obsidian Flavored Markdown]]. Some apps use slightly different Markdown syntax. You can use [[Format converter]] to convert your files to Obsidian's Markdown syntax.
