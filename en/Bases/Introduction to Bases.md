---
Bases is a [[Core plugins|core plugin]] that lets you create database-like views of your notes. Using a base you can view, edit, sort, and filter files and their [[Properties|properties]]. Bases can help you organize everything from projects to travel plans, reading lists, andÂ more.

Each base can have several [[Views|views]] with different layouts such as tables and cards. Below is an example of table view where each row is a file, and each column is a property of that file.
