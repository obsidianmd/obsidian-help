Select ![[lucide-list.svg#icon]]  **List** from the view menu to display files as a [[Basic formatting syntax#Lists|list]] with bulleted or numbered markers.

## Settings

List view settings can be configured in [[Views#View settings|View settings]].

- Markers: bullets, numbers or none
- Indent properties
- Separators for properties

### Markers

Choose the type of list marker your want to use: bullets, numbers, or none.

### Indent properties

When toggled on, any properties you select in the **Properties** menu will be displayed as indented items for the primary list item.

To change your primary list item, move a property in the **Properties** menu to the top, by dragging it or using the `Alt + Up/Down` shortcut.

### Separators

When **nested properties** is toggled off, this setting defines a character to separate the properties for each list item. Defaults to a comma.
