Panes can be linked together. This has two main effects:

- By default, when opening a new [[Preview and edit modes|Preview pane]] from an editing pane, the new pane is linked to the old one. This means that any changes you make in the editor will show up in the preview in real time. It also means that scrolling one will scroll the other.

- When a new [[Backlinks#View backlinks in new pane|Backlink pane]] is created from a note, it will be linked to that note. This means that backlinks will always be shown for the note that is in that pane. This is useful if you want to reference a set of backlinks and want the regular backlink panel to change with you as you view other notes.

Linked panes will be marked with a link icon <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="18" height="18" class="link"><path fill="currentColor" stroke="currentColor" d="M74,8c-4.8,0-9.3,1.9-12.7,5.3l-10,10c-2.9,2.9-4.7,6.6-5.1,10.6C46,34.6,46,35.3,46,36c0,2.7,0.6,5.4,1.8,7.8l3.1-3.1 C50.3,39.2,50,37.6,50,36c0-3.7,1.5-7.3,4.1-9.9l10-10c2.6-2.6,6.2-4.1,9.9-4.1s7.3,1.5,9.9,4.1c2.6,2.6,4.1,6.2,4.1,9.9 s-1.5,7.3-4.1,9.9l-10,10C71.3,48.5,67.7,50,64,50c-1.6,0-3.2-0.3-4.7-0.8l-3.1,3.1c2.4,1.1,5,1.8,7.8,1.8c4.8,0,9.3-1.9,12.7-5.3 l10-10C90.1,35.3,92,30.8,92,26s-1.9-9.3-5.3-12.7C83.3,9.9,78.8,8,74,8L74,8z M62,36c-0.5,0-1,0.2-1.4,0.6l-24,24 c-0.5,0.5-0.7,1.2-0.6,1.9c0.2,0.7,0.7,1.2,1.4,1.4c0.7,0.2,1.4,0,1.9-0.6l24-24c0.6-0.6,0.8-1.5,0.4-2.2C63.5,36.4,62.8,36,62,36 z M36,46c-4.8,0-9.3,1.9-12.7,5.3l-10,10c-3.1,3.1-5,7.2-5.2,11.6c0,0.4,0,0.8,0,1.2c0,4.8,1.9,9.3,5.3,12.7 C16.7,90.1,21.2,92,26,92s9.3-1.9,12.7-5.3l10-10C52.1,73.3,54,68.8,54,64c0-2.7-0.6-5.4-1.8-7.8l-3.1,3.1 c0.5,1.5,0.8,3.1,0.8,4.7c0,3.7-1.5,7.3-4.1,9.9l-10,10C33.3,86.5,29.7,88,26,88s-7.3-1.5-9.9-4.1S12,77.7,12,74 c0-3.7,1.5-7.3,4.1-9.9l10-10c2.6-2.6,6.2-4.1,9.9-4.1c1.6,0,3.2,0.3,4.7,0.8l3.1-3.1C41.4,46.6,38.7,46,36,46L36,46z"></path></svg> in the title bar of every linked pane.
