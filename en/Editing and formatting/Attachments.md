You can import [[Accepted file formats]], or _attachments_, to your vault, such as images, audio files, or PDFs. Attachments are regular files that you can access using your file system.

## Add an attachment

You can add attachments to your vault in multiple ways. Only [[Accepted file formats]] can be added.

> [!todo]- Copy and paste attachments
> You can paste attachments directly into your notes. Obsidian creates a file with the pasted content in the default attachment location and [[Embed files|embeds]] it in the note.

> [!todo]- Drag and drop attachments
> If you drag a file from your file system into an open editor, Obsidian copies the file to the default attachment location and [[Embed files|embeds]] it in the note.

 > [!todo]- Download attachments to vault folder
 > You can download an attachment directly to your vault, for example if you  [[Import notes#Import from browser|import from your browser]], or from other apps that saves files directly to your file system.

## Change default attachment location

By default, attachments are added to the root of your vault.

You can change the default attachment location under **Settings → Files & Links → Default location for new attachments**.

- **Vault folder** adds the attachment to the root of your vault.
- **In the folder specified below** adds the attachment to a specified folder.
- **Same folder as current file** adds the attachment to the same folder as the note you added it to.
- **In subfolder under current folder** adds attachments to a specified folder next to the note you added the attachment to. If it doesn't exist, Obsidian creates it when you add an attachment.
