Learn how to get a better overview of large notes by using _folding_ to hide parts of the note. Folding is useful when creating outlines for your notes and when you want to focus on what you're working on at the moment.

You can fold headings and indented lists by hovering the mouse cursor over the section you want to fold, and then selecting the arrow on the left. Folded sections show an arrow regardless of if you hover it or not.

Folding is turned on by default. To turn off folding, open **Settings** → **Editor**, and then turn off **Fold indent** or **Fold heading**, depending on your needs.

To toggle all sections at the same time, use the following commands:

- To collapse all sections, open the [[Command palette]], and then select **Fold all headings and lists**.
- To expand all sections, open the [[Command palette]], and then select **Unfold all headings and lists**.

> [!tip]
> If you prefer to fold using your keyboard, you can assign [[Hotkeys|hotkeys]] to the **Fold less** and **Fold more** commands.
>
> - **Fold less** unfolds the section at the text cursor.
> - **Fold more** folds the section or list that contains the text cursor.
