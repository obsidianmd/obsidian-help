Use callouts to include additional content without breaking the flow of your notes.

To create a callout, add `[!info]` to the first line of a blockquote, where `info` is the _type identifier_. The type identifier determines how the callout looks and feels. To see all available types, refer to [[#Supported types]].

```markdown
> [!info]
> Here's a callout block.
> It supports **Markdown**, [[Internal link|Wikilinks]], and [[Embed files|embeds]]!
> ![[Engelbart.jpg]]
```

> [!info]
> Here's a callout block.
> It supports **Markdown**, [[Internal links|Wikilinks]] and [[Embed files|embeds]]!
> ![[Engelbart.jpg]]

Callouts are also supported natively on [[Introduction to Obsidian Publish|Obsidian Publish]].

> [!note]
> If you're also using the Admonitions plugin, you should update it to at least version 8.0.0 to avoid problems with the new callout feature.

### Change the title

By default, the title of the callout is its type identifier in title case. You can change it by adding text after the type identifier:

```markdown
> [!tip] Callouts can have custom titles
> Like this one.
```

> [!tip] Callouts can have custom titles
> Like this one.

You can even omit the body to create title-only callouts:

```markdown
> [!tip] Title-only callout
```

> [!tip] Title-only callout

### Foldable callouts

You can make a callout foldable by adding a plus (+) or a minus (-) directly after the type identifier.

A plus sign expands the callout by default, and a minus sign collapses it instead.

```markdown
> [!faq]- Are callouts foldable?
> Yes! In a foldable callout, the contents are hidden when the callout is collapsed.
```

> [!faq]- Are callouts foldable?
> Yes! In a foldable callout, the contents are hidden when collapsed.

### Nested callouts

You can nest callouts in multiple levels.

```markdown
> [!question] Can callouts be nested?
> > [!todo] Yes!, they can.
> > > [!example]  You can even use multiple layers of nesting.
```

> [!question] Can callouts be nested?
> > [!todo] Yes!, they can.
> > > [!example]  You can even use multiple layers of nesting.

### Customize callouts

[[CSS snippets]] and [[Community plugins]] can define custom callouts, or even overwrite the default configuration.

To define a custom callout, create the following CSS block:

```css
.callout[data-callout="custom-question-type"] {
    --callout-color: 0, 0, 0;
    --callout-icon: lucide-alert-circle;
}
```

The value of the `data-callout` attribute is the type identifier you want to use, for example `[!custom-question-type]`.

- `--callout-color` defines the background color using numbers (0â€“255) for red, green, and blue.
- `--callout-icon` can be an icon ID from [lucide.dev](https://lucide.dev), or an SVG element. 

> [!warning] Note about lucide icon versions
> Obsidian updates Lucide icons periodically. The current version included is shown below; use these or earlier icons in custom callouts.
> ![[Credits#^lucide]]

> [!tip] SVG icons
> Instead of using a Lucide icon, you can also use a SVG element as the callout icon.
>
> ```css
> --callout-icon: '<svg>...custom svg...</svg>';
> ```

### Supported types

You can use several callout types and aliases. Each type comes with a different background color and icon.

To use these default styles, replace `info` in the examples with any of these types, such as `[!tip]` or `[!warning]`. Callout types can also be changed by right-clicking a callout.

Unless you [[#Customize callouts]], any unsupported type defaults to the `note` type. The type identifier is case-insensitive.
