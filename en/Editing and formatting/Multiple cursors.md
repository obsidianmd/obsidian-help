Obsidian lets you edit text in multiple places at the same time using multiple cursors. You can add additional cursors by holding `Alt` (or `Option` on macOS) and selecting another position in the note.

To remove a selection along with all additional cursors, click anywhere in the note without holding a key. You can also remove the selection by pressing `Escape`.

## Rectangular selection

If you want to edit consecutive lines of text—for example, to turn paragraphs into list items—you can hold `Shift+Alt` (or `Shift+Option` on macOS) while dragging. You can also hold the middle mouse button while dragging.
