Obsidian lets you customize how to edit and preview notes with Markdown syntax using _editor views_ and _editor modes_.

Markdown is a markup language that uses special syntax to format text that's mainly useful when editing your notes. Less so when reading them. Instead, Obsidian can show them in a way that's more suitable for reading.

Editor views and modes lets you customize how Markdown syntax appears when you're editing and reading notes.

## Editor views

You can switch between the _editing view_ and _reading view_, depending on whether you intend to make changes to the note.

To switch between views, select the view switcher ( ![[lucide-book-icon.svg#icon]] or ![[lucide-edit-3.svg#icon]] ) in the upper-right corner of the editor, or press `Ctrl+E` (or `Cmd+E` on macOS) in the editor.

> [!note]
> You need to enable **Settings → Appearance → Show tab title bar** to see the icon for switching views.

You can change the default editor view under **Settings → Editor → Default view for new tabs**.

> [!tip] Side-by-side preview
> To open a note in both editing and reading view side-by-side, press `Ctrl` (or `Cmd` on macOS) and select the view switcher ( ![[lucide-book-icon.svg#icon]] or ![[lucide-edit-3.svg#icon]] ) in the upper-right corner of the editor.

## Editor modes

In Editing view, you can edit your notes using one of two modes, _Live Preview_ or _Source mode_.

You can change the default editor mode under **Settings → Editor → Default editing mode**.

### Live Preview

Live Preview is a smart editor mode that previews Markdown-formatted text while you're editing.

You can reveal the syntax for any Markdown-formatted text by moving the text cursor to it.

> [!tip]
> Since Live Preview lets you see the formatting in the editing view, it often removes the need to switch between editor views.

### Source mode

Source mode displays the Markdown syntax for the entire note.

Use Source mode if you prefer to see the plain text representation of the note.
