There are many ways to drag and drop elements in Obsidian. This includes tabs, files, folders, and content.

### Drag tabs

- You can [[Tabs#Arrange tabs|arrange tabs]] and split tab groups in the main content area and in [[Sidebar|sidebars]].

### Drag sources

- You can drag a file, or multiple files from the [[file explorer]].
- You can drag a file from a [[search]] result.
- You can drag a file from [[backlinks]] or unlinked references.
- You can drag a file from a link inside the note, in preview mode.

### Drop destinations

- You can drop a file on a tab header to open the file there. Hold `Alt` (or `Shift` on macOS) to drop anywhere in the tab.
- You can drop a file on a folder in the [[file explorer]] to move the file there.
- You can drop a file into an editor to insert it as a link. The generated link also follows your preferences, such as relative paths, or using Markdown links.
- You can drop a file on the [[Bookmarks]] tab to bookmark it.

### Dragging from outside Obsidian

- You can drag any HTML content from the browser into Obsidian to automatically convert them into Markdown
- You can drag and drop any files from your native file explorer to have Obsidian import (make a copy of) those files in your vault's attachment folder and insert them as internal links. Hold `Ctrl` on Windows/Linux or `Option` on macOS to create `file:///` absolute links to those files instead of importing a copy.

### Dropping files outside Obsidian

- This creates an `obsidian://` URL in the external application for the Obsidian note that you dragged.
