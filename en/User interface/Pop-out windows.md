You can open separate _pop-out_ windows in Obsidian. Each pop-out window is associated with its respective vault window. If you close a vault window, all of its pop-out windows will close as well.

Files can only be moved between windows associated with the same vault.

**Command palette:**

In the [[Command palette]], select **Open current tab in new window**.

**Tab:**

Right-click a tab and select **Move to new window**. Alternatively, select **More options** ( ![[lucide-more-horizontal.svg#icon]] ) in the upper-right corner of the editor, then choose **Move to new window**.
