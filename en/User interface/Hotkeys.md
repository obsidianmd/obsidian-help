Hotkeys are customizable keyboard shortcuts for Obsidian commands. You can assign any keyboard combination to trigger commands like opening files, inserting templates, or toggling plugins.

Hotkeys are different from [[Editing shortcuts|system keyboard shortcuts]] (like `Ctrl+C` for copy), which are provided by your operating system and cannot be customized in Obsidian.

## View hotkeys

The fastest way to see the hotkey set for a command is to find the command in the [[Command palette]]. If there's a hotkey listed for that command, it's set.

You can also view and manage all hotkeys in **Settings → Hotkeys**.

## Set a hotkey

To add or modify a hotkey:

1. Open **Settings → Hotkeys**.
2. Find the command in the list or use the search filter.
3. Select the plus (+) icon next to the command.
4. Press the keyboard combination you want to use.
5. Select **Save** to confirm.

You can assign multiple hotkey combinations to a single command by selecting the plus (+) icon again after setting the first hotkey.

## Remove a hotkey

To remove a hotkey:

1. Open **Settings → Hotkeys**.
2. Find the command with the hotkey you want to remove.
3. Select the X icon next to the keyboard combination.

## Filter hotkeys

To show only commands that have assigned hotkeys, select the filter icon in **Settings → Hotkeys**.

## Non-US keyboard layouts

Hotkeys are displayed as they would appear on a US keyboard layout. Even if the displayed combination doesn't match your keyboard layout, the hotkey will work based on the actual keys you pressed (as long as you don't change your keyboard layout).

## Default keyboard shortcuts

For a comprehensive list of default keyboard shortcuts for editing and navigation, see [[Editing shortcuts]].
