Obsidian allows you to customize hotkeys, also known as keyboard shortcuts.

Default hotkeys are only defined for the most commonly used [[Command palette|commands]]. If you frequently use a command, you can define a hotkey for it. See also [[Editing shortcuts]].

### Viewing hotkeys

The fastest way to see the hotkey set for a command is to find the command in [[Command palette]]. If there's a hotkey listed for that command, it's set.

### Setting hotkeys

To add a hotkey, remove a hotkey, or restore hotkeys to default, go to Settings => Hotkeys. You can also filter the list, as the list of commands is quite long.

**Note for non-US users:** Even if the hotkey you type doesn't match on screen with what you would expect to see (given your keyboard layout), it will work fine following the actual buttons you pressed (as long as you donâ€™t change layout).

The hotkey that appears on screen is the one that you would have to perform if you were using a US keyboard.
