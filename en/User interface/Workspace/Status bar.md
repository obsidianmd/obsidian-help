The status bar shows handy information. That includes helpful information about the current file, the current vault, or the current status like time and date.

Status items are added both by [[Core plugins|core plugins]] and [[Community plugins]]. Some items are interactive but some are purely informational. 

For example, the [[Word count]] plugin adds the word and character count that’s not clickable, and the [[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Sync plugin]] adds an icon that both shows the sync status as well as shows the sync log upon being clicked.
