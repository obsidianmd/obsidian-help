The ribbon is a space for common commands.

On desktop, it occupies the vertical space at the very left of the interface. It’s part of the left [[Sidebar]] and is always visible, even if the left sidebar is closed.

On mobile, when you’re not editing a note, you can access the ribbon by tapping the **Menu option** (![[lucide-menu.svg|icon]]) at the bottom right corner of the app.

## Actions

Each action is presented by an icon in the ribbon. Hovering them will present a tooltip; clicking or tapping them will activate the action.

The top ones are added by plugins, both [[Core plugins|core plugins]] and [[Community plugins]].

The bottom three actions are Obsidian system actions to:

1. Open another vault.
2. Get help.
3. Open settings.

## Customizing ribbon

You can rearrange the order of ribbon actions by dragging and dropping the icons. 

To hide certain actions, you can right click on empty space on the ribbon and uncheck certain actions to hide them.

Ribbon layout will be remembered across sessions. It will get synchronized to other devices and mobile app if app settings, specifically the `workspace.json` file, is synchronized.
