### Color scheme

Obsidian comes with two color schemes, light and dark. By default, the color scheme is set to adapt to your operating system. You can change this by going to **Settings → Appearance**.

### Custom themes

You can the appearance of Obsidian by using custom [[themes]]. You can browse hundreds of community-made themes by going to **Settings → Appearance**, then click **Manage** to view and install themes.

You can also [create your own theme](https://docs.obsidian.md/Themes/App+themes/Build+a+theme), and tweak themes using [[CSS snippets]].

### Translucency

You can make the window translucent by enabling this option in the settings appearance tab. Currently this option is only available for Windows and macOS.

There's a known issue under Windows where dragging the window is extremely slow when translucency is enabled. This is due to a Windows bug. A GitHub issue tracking the status of a fix can be found here: https://github.com/riverar/sample-win32-acrylicblur/issues/2

### Custom app icon

You can change the Obsidian app icon. If you're unsure where to begin, explore Obsidian's default icon editor featured on [our blog](https://obsidian.md/blog/new-obsidian-icon/). This feature is currently only available in the Obsidian desktop app.

To change the Obsidian app icon, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Select **Appearance** on the left.
3. Scroll down to the **Advanced** section.
4. On the right side of the settings menu, click on **Choose** next to the custom app icon.
5. Pick your desired icon from your filesystem.  Accepted file formats are `.icns`, `.ico`, `.png`, and `.svg`.
6. Click **Relaunch**.
7. After Obsidian restarts, your new icon should appear in the taskbar on desktop and on your screen on mobile.
