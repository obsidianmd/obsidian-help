If you know your way around a code editor, you can improve and extend the Obsidian experience for the rest of the community.

- If you know CSS, you can create your own theme for Obsidian. For more information about how to create themes, refer to the [Obsidian Hub for Theme Designers](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/04+-+Guides%2C+Workflows%2C+%26+Courses/for+Theme+Designers).

- If you know TypeScript or JavaScript, you can build a plugin to extend Obsidian with new features. For more information about building plugins for Obsidian, refer to the [Plugin Developer Docs](https://marcus.se.net/obsidian-plugin-docs/).

Share what you've built in the `#css-themes` and `#plugin-dev` channels on our Discord server, or in the Share & Showcase category on our forum.

When you're ready, [submit your plugin or theme](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases#submit-your-plugin-or-theme) to the official directory so that users can install your creations directly from Obsidian.
