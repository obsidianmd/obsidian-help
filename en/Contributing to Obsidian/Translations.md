If you know another language, preferably natively, you can help translate the Obsidian user interface or the documentation.

To help translate the user interface, submit a pull request to the [translations repository](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-translations).

To help improve our documentation, submit a pull request to the [obsidian-help](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-help) repository. Make sure to adhere to the translation [[Style guide#Translations|translations style guide]] when making changes.
