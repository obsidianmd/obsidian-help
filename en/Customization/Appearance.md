### Base mode

Obsidian comes with two "Base Modes", light and dark. Dark is the default. We call it a "mode" rather than a "theme" because the base mode is the foundation that a custom theme works on top of.

You can change your base mode in Settings -> Appearance.

### Custom theme

You can enable the [[Custom CSS]] plugin to start customizing your Obsidian in greater detail.

As a great starting point, once you enable custom CSS, there are lots of community themes contributed by our amazing community that you can easily choose from.

Once you choose a community theme, you can still add your own tweaks to it by modifying the `obsidian.css` file.
