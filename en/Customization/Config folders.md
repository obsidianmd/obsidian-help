By default, Obsidian's vault configuration folder is `.obsidian`. If using a syncing service, or you wish to test different profiles in the same vault, you may want to change your config folder. 

## Changing your config folder

To set your config folder:

1. Open **Settings → Files and Links**.
2. In **Override config folder**, type the name of your profile, starting with a period (`.`). For example, `.obsidian-awesome`.
3. Relaunch Obsidian to have the changes take effect. 

> [!info] Any settings within your config folder will not transfer to your new config folder. However, your prior config folder will remain within your vault folder.
