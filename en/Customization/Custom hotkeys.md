Most hotkeys are customizable in Obsidian.

We only defined default hotkeys for the most commonly used commands, but if you frequently use a command, it would save you lots of time if you add a hotkey for it.

For a list of default hotkeys, [[Use hotkeys|see here]].

### Viewing hotkeys

The fastest way to see the hotkey set for a command is to find the command in [[Command palette]]. If there's a hotkey listed for that command, it's set.

### Setting hotkeys

To add a hotkey, remove a hotkey, or restore hotkeys to default, go to Settings => Hotkeys. Note that you can also filter the list, as the list of commands is quite long.
