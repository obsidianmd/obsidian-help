Each note in Obsidian is displayed in its own pane. These can be split, duplicated, and moved around to create the workspace you need.

Panes can be rearranged by dragging the icon in the top left of the pane. Dropping onto each of the four sides of an existing pane creates a horizontal or vertical split, and dropping in the center swaps positions with the target pane. 

Panes can be moved to sidebars as well, and sidebars can be repositioned in the same way. A drop onto a the top or bottom of the sidebar will create a vertical split, and a drop in the center creates a stack of tabs that you can swap between. You can, for example, move the file explorer and search to the right side with the backlinks sidebar. Or, you can have a note you are referring to often, such as a table of contents or your daily note, sitting in one of the sidebars, while you navigate freely in the editor. Files can still be edited while in the sidebar as well, so this can be a helpful place to keep a running list of links or an ongoing checklist. This can also be very helpful when working with backlinks.

Panes can be manually linked to one another by using the more options menu (the three dots icon in the top right corner of the pane). You can also open backlinks for a specific pane in the more options menu, which will be linked to just that file. There's also an option for it in the [[Command Palette]].
