### Report bugs and request features

> [!important]
> Before you request a new feature or report a bug, please look through the other posts to make sure someone else hasn't already submitted it.

If you want to suggest a feature in Obsidian, head over to [Feature requests](https://forum.obsidian.md/c/feature-requests/8).

If you want to report a bug, head over to [Bug reports](https://forum.obsidian.md/c/bug-reports/7). Bug reports are moved to the [Bug graveyard](https://forum.obsidian.md/c/bug-graveyard/12) once they're resolved.

### Contact Obsidian support

Obsidian offers email support only for inquiries about [[Commercial license|commercial licenses]], your account, payment, and add-on services ([[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]] and [[Introduction to Obsidian Publish|Obsidian Publish]]). If you need help with any of those topics, [email the Obsidian team](mailto:support@obsidian.md).

### Collect debug information

When you encounter a bug or need assistance from Obsidian support, it's helpful to provide them with your Obsidian application's debug information. Here's how you can obtain it:

1. Open the [[Command palette]].
2. Type **Show debug info**.
3. Select the highlighted **Show debug info** option.
4. Click the **Copy to clipboard** button.
5. Paste the copied information into your bug report or Obsidian support email.

### Capture console logs

When you need to report a bug related to an Obsidian plugin, or when requested to provide log information, you may need to access the Obsidian console. Here's how you can do it based on your operating system:

- **Windows**: `CTRL + SHIFT + i`  
- **MacOS**: `CMD + OPTION + i`  
- **Linux**: `CTRL + SHIFT + i`

Once you've opened the developer console:

1. Select on **console** in the top menu.
2. Choose the **errors** side menu option. Any errors will be displayed as `# errors`.
3. Select one of the red error messages.
4. Choose the option to **Save as...** This will save all the errors in the console.
5. Save the log file to your device.
6. Attach the log file to your bug report or Obsidian support email.

> [!warning] Mobile devices/tablets have limited access to their developer consoles. For these users, we recommend using the community plugin [Logstravaganza](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=logstravaganza) to automatically generate the console log data in a markdown note.
