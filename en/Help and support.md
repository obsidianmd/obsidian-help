### Collect debug information

When you encounter a bug or need assistance from [[#Contact Obsidian support|Obsidian support]], providing debug information can be very helpful. Here's how to obtain it:

1. Open the [[Command palette]].
2. Type **Show debug info**.
3. Select the highlighted **Show debug info** option.
4. Click **Copy to clipboard**.
5. Paste the copied information into your bug report or Obsidian support email.

### Capture console logs

When you need to report a bug related to an Obsidian plugin or when requested by [[#Contact Obsidian support|Obsidian support]] to provide log information, you may need to access the Obsidian console from within the Obsidian application. Here’s how to do it based on your operating system:

- **Windows**: `CTRL + SHIFT + i`  
- **MacOS**: `CMD + OPTION + i`  
- **Linux**: `CTRL + SHIFT + i`

Once you've opened the developer console:

1. Select on **console** in the top menu.
2. Choose the **errors** side menu option. Any errors will be displayed as `# errors`.
3. Select one of the red error messages.
4. Choose the option to **Save as...** This will save all the errors in the console.
5. Save the log file to your device.
6. Attach the log file to your bug report or Obsidian support email.
