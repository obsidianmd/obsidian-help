Obsidian allows you to easily migrate your notes from Apple Notes using the official [[Importer|Importer plugin]].

## Export your data from Apple Notes

Apple does not provide a native option to export your notes. However several third-party tools exist.

The most user-friendly option is [Exporter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/exporter/id1099120373) by Chintan Ghate.

More advanced options for experienced developers include [Apple Cloud Notes Parser](https://github.com/threeplanetssoftware/apple_cloud_notes_parser) and [Apple Notes Liberator](https://github.com/HamburgChimps/apple-notes-liberator).

## Import Apple Notes data into Obsidian

You will need the official Obsidian [[Importer]] plugin, which you can [install here](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-importer).

Depending on the tool you used, the export may be in Markdown format or HTML format. Follow instructions based on the file format you exported to: 

- [[Import HTML files]]
- [[Import Markdown files]]
