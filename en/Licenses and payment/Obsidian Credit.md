Obsidian Credit is a type of prepaid credit that can be bought in advance and applied toward purchases of any Obsidian service or license. Obsidian Credit can be [[#Gifting|gifted]] to other Obsidian users, such as friends, family, and coworkers.

Obsidian Credit will be applied before any payment is due, including auto-renewals. Obsidian Credit is not eligible for a refund per our [[Refund policy]].

## Add credit

1. Log into [your Obsidian account](https://obsidian.md/account/billing).
2. In the [Billing](https://obsidian.md/account/billing) section, go to **Obsidian Credit** and choose **Buy credit**.
3. Enter the amount of Obsidian Credit you want to buy. The amount is in US dollars.
4. Proceed to pay for the credit with any of the supported payment methods.

> [!Note] Sales tax
> Any applicable sales tax will be charged when you make a purchase of a product, such as Obsidian Sync, not when you buy Obsidian Credit.
>
> If you plan to cover auto-renewals with your credit, please keep this factor in mind.
