Obsidian Credit is a type of prepaid credit. It can be bought in advance and applied towards purchases of all things Obsidian has to offer.

Obsidian Credit will be applied before any payment is due, and it will also be applied at auto-renewals.

## Add credit

1. Log into [your Obsidian account](https://obsidian.md/account).
2. Under **Payment & billing → Obsidian Credit**, click **Add**.
3. Enter the amount of Obsidian Credit you want to buy. The amount is in US dollars.
4. Proceed to pay for the credit with any of the supported payment methods.

> [!Note] Sales tax
> Any applicable sales tax will be charged when you actually buy something, not when you buy Obsidian Credit.
>
> If you plan to cover auto-renewals with your credit, please take this into account.
