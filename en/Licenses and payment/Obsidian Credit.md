Obsidian Credit is a type of prepaid credit that can be bought in advance and applied toward purchases of any Obsidian service or license. Obsidian Credit can be [[#Gifting|gifted]] to other Obsidian users, such as friends, family, and coworkers.

Obsidian Credit will be applied before any payment is due, including auto-renewals. Obsidian Credit **is not** eligible for a refund per our [[Refund policy]].

## Add credit

1. Log into [your Obsidian account](https://obsidian.md/account/billing).
2. In the [Billing](https://obsidian.md/account/billing) section, go to **Obsidian Credit** and choose **Buy credit**.
3. Enter the amount of Obsidian Credit you want to buy. The amount is in US dollars.
4. Proceed to pay for the credit with any of the supported payment methods.

> [!Note] Sales tax
> Any applicable [[sales tax]] will be charged when you make a purchase of a product, such as Obsidian Sync, not when you buy Obsidian Credit.
>
> If you plan to cover auto-renewals with your credit, please keep this factor in mind.

## Gifting

Although Obsidian is completely free for personal use, you can give the gift of Obsidian Credit to help someone get an add-on service like [[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]] or a [[Commercial license|Commercial license]] for using Obsidian at work.

Please note that Obsidian Credit **cannot** be re-gifted once claimed. The original recipient will not be able to transfer or share it with others.
