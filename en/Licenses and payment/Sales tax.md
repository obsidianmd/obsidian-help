In some jurisdictions, Obsidian is required to collect sales taxes on behalf of customers purchasing software licenses and services. Sales taxes may apply to [[Commercial license|Commercial licenses]], [[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]], and [[Introduction to Obsidian Publish|Obsidian Publish]]. Sales taxes generally do not apply to [[Obsidian Credit]] and [[Catalyst license|Catalyst]].

To determine the taxes applied to your purchase, we use the country and postal code you provide at checkout or in the Billing section of your dashboard. This information is stored on your account so that we can accurately charge sales tax if there is a change in tax law or other requirements that obligate us to do so.

## Tax exemption

Depending on your country and status, you may be exempt from taxes by submitting your Tax Identification Number (TIN), VAT Number, VAT ID, or tax exemption certificate.

You can apply for a tax exemption via the Billing section of your [Account dashboard](https://obsidian.md/account/billing). If your application is approved, future purchases will not be charged taxes.

4. In the pop-up window:
    1. Enter your country.
