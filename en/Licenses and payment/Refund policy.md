## FAQ

**What happens if I refund my service?**
If you are refunding an Obsidian Sync or Obsidian Publish subscription, any remote vaults or publish sites are deleted, and can not be retrieved even if you subscribe again.

>[!info] Please note that this does not happen if your [[Sync limitations#How long do you keep my data after my subscription expires?|subscription expires]].

If you are refunding an Obsidian Commercial license, the associated license key will be deactivated.
