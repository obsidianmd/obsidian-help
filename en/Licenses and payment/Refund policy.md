## Frequently asked questions

**What happens if I refund my service?**

Refunding an Obsidian Sync or Obsidian Publish subscription results in the deletion of any remote vaults or publish sites, which cannot be retrieved even if you subscribe again. However, your local data on your devices will remain unaffected.

**What if I miss a payment and my subscription expires? Will I lose my remote vault data?**

No, your data is retained in such cases for 30 days. If you do not resubscribe within that period, your remote vault or publish site data will be deleted. Your local data will remain unaffected.

**If I qualify for a discount but have paid for my subscription in the past 7 days, what should I do?**
Please contact [[Help and support#Contact Obsidian support|Obsidian support]] so we can assess your options.

**I purchased my subscription a few weeks ago and now qualify for a discount. Can I get a partial refund?**
We understand that some may have purchased Sync or Publish without discounts, either due to being unaware of the discount or not qualifying for it at the time. Unfortunately, we do not offer refunds in such cases. However, future renewals will automatically apply the discount if the discount is still valid.
