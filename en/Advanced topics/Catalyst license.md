Obsidian is free for personal use. A Catalyst license is an optional license that provides the following benefits:

1. It gives you early access to the latest, cutting edge versions of the app
2. Provides you cool badges on our community Discord server and forum
3. And, it helps support the development of Obsidian (thank you 💜!)

There are three tiers of the Catalyst license: $25, $50, and $100 - each of which gives you [[Insider builds|access to insider builds]].

Please note that Catalyst is optional and ==does not give you any additional app features==.

To upgrade to Catalyst, please visit [our pricing page](https://obsidian.md/pricing).

If you use Obsidian for work-related activities, you may need a [[Commercial license|commercial license]].
