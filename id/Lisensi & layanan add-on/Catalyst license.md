Obsidian is free for personal use. A Catalyst license is an optional license that provides the following benefits:

1. It gives you early access to the latest, cutting edge versions of the app;
2. Provides you cool badges on our community Discord server and forum; and
3. It helps support the development of Obsidian (thank you 💜!)

There are three tiers of the Catalyst license: $25, $50, and $100 - each of which gives you [[Versi insider|access to insider builds]].

Please note that Catalyst is optional and ==does not give you any additional app features==.

To upgrade to Catalyst, please visit [our pricing page](https://obsidian.md/pricing). If you're in our community, make sense to fill in your Discord user name and/or your forum user name, so that we can add badges for you.

If you use Obsidian for work-related activities, you may need a [[Commercial license|commercial license]].
