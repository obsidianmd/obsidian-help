We started making Obsidian with plugins in mind because everyone seems to take notes differently. Offering a generic set of tools for a note-taker is like offering only one configuration of kitchen for passionate home cooks.

There are two types of plugins in Obsidian: core plugins and community plugins.

## Modular core plugins

Core plugins are made by us, and they give Obsidian basic modularity. “Modularity” is just a fancy word for having neat features that can be turned on and off without affecting the other pieces.

## Wild community plugins

Plugins not only provide Obsidian with modularity, but also enhance its extensibility. Extensibility means other people can add features to Obsidian as they see fit.

Unfortunately, you’d need to know some coding to know how to do that. But fortunately, Obsidian has a community plugin store that lets you install these community plugins with one click.

A big shoutout to plugin developers who are generously sharing their own gems with the community!
